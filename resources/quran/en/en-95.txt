## 15.  THE ROCK   (al-Hijr)  
32. He said, “O Satan, what kept you from be-
ing among those who prostrated them-
selves?”  
33. He said, “I am not about to prostrate my-
self before a human being, whom You created 
from clay, from molded mud.”  
34. He said, “Then ge t out of here, for you are 
an outcast”.  
35. “And the curse will be upon you until the 
Day of Judgment.”  
36. He said, “My Lord, reprieve me until the 
Day they are resurrected.”  
37. He said, “You are of those reprieved.”  
38. “Until the Day of the time appoin ted.”  
39. He said, “My Lord, since You have lured 
me away, I will glamorize for them on earth, 
and I will lure them all away.”  
40. “Except for Your sincere servants among 
them.”  
41. He said, “This is a right way with Me.”  
42. “Over My servants you have no authority, 
except for the sinners who follow you.”  
43. And Hell is the meeting -place for them all.  
44. “It has seven doors; for each door is an as-
signed class.”  
45. But the righteous will be in gardens with 
springs.  
46. “Enter it in peace and security.”  
47. And We will remove all ill -feelings from 
their hearts —brothers and sisters, on 
couches facing one another.  
48. No fatigue will ever touch them therein, 
nor will they be asked to leave it.  
49. Inform My servants that I am the Forgiver, 
the Merciful.  
50. And that My punishment is the painful 
punishment.  
51. And inform them of the guests of Abra-
ham.  
52. When they entered upon him, and said, 
“Peace.” He said, “We are wary of you.”  53. They said, “Do not fear; we bring you good 
news of a boy endowed with knowledge.”  
54. He said, “Do you bring me good news, 
when old age has overtaken me? What good news do you bring?”  
55. They said, “We bring you good news in 
truth, so do not despair.”  
56. He said, “And who despairs of his Lord’s 
mercy but the lost?”  
57. He said, “So what is your business, O en-
voys?”  
58. They said, “We were sent to a sinful peo-
ple.”  
59. “Except for the family of Lot; we will save 
them all.”  
60. “Except for his wife.” We have determined 
that she will be of those who lag behind.  
61. And when th e envoys came to the family of 
Lot. 
62. He said, “You are a people unknown to 
me.”  
63. They said, “We bring you what they have 
doubts about.”  
64. “We bring you the truth, and we are truth-
ful.”  
65. “Travel with your family at the dead of the 
night, and foll ow up behind them, and let 
none of you look back, and proceed as com-manded.”  
66. And We informed him of Our decree: the 
last remnant of these will be uprooted by early morning.  
67. And the people of the town came joyfully.  
68. He said, “These are my guests , so do not 
embarrass me.”  
69. “And fear Allah, and do not disgrace me.”  
70. They said, “Did we not forbid you from 
strangers?”  
71. He said, “These are my daughters, if you 
must.”  
72. By your life, they were blundering in their 
drunkenness.
