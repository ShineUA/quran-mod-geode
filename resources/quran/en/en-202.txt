## 52. THE MOUNT  (at-Tur) 
25. And they will approach one another, in-
quiring.  
26. They will s ay, “Before this, we were fearful 
for our families.  
27. But Allah blessed us, and spared us the ag-
ony of the Fiery Winds.  
28. Before this, we used to pray to Him. He is 
the Good, the Compassionate.”  
29. So remind. By the grace of your Lord, you 
are neither  a soothsayer, nor a madman.  
30. Or do they say, “A poet— we await for him 
a calamity of time”?  
31. Say, “Go on waiting; I will be waiting with 
you.”  
32. Or is it that their dreams compel them to 
this? Or are they aggressive people?  
33. Or do they say, “He made it up”? Rather, 
they do not believe.  
34. So let them produce a discourse like it, if 
they are truthful.  
35. Or were they created out of nothing? Or 
are they the creators?  
36. Or did they create the heavens and the 
earth? In fact, they are not certain.  
37. Or do they possess the treasuries of your 
Lord? Or are they the controllers?  
38. Or do they have a stairway by means of 
which they listen? Then let their listener pro-
duce a clear proof.  
39. Or for Him the daughters, and for you the 
sons?  
40. Or do you  demand a payment from them, 
and they are burdened by debt?  
41. Or do they know the future, and they are 
writing it down?  
42. Or are they planning a conspiracy? The 
conspiracy will befall the disbelievers.  
43. Or do they have a god besides Allah? Allah 
transcends what they associate.  
44. Even if they were to see lumps of the sky 
falling down, they would say, “A mass of 
clouds.”  45. So leave them until they meet their Day in 
which they will be stunned.  
46. The Day when their ploys will avail them 
nothing; and they will not be helped.  
47. For those who do wrong, there is a punish-
ment besides that; but most of them do not 
know.  
48. So patiently await the decision of your 
Lord, for you are before Our Eyes; and pro-
claim the praises of your Lord when you 
arise.  
49. And glorify Him during the night, and at 
the receding of the stars.  
  
## 53. THE STAR  (an-Najm)  
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. By the star as it goes down.  
2. Your friend has not gone astray, nor has he 
erred.  
3. Nor does he speak out of desire.  
4. It is but a revelation revealed.  
5. Taught to him by the Extremely Powerful.  
6. The one of vigor. He settled.  
7. While he was at the highest horizon.  
8. Then he came near, and hovered around.  
9. He was within two bows’ length, or closer.  
10. Then He revealed to His servant what He 
revealed.  
11. The heart did not lie about what it saw.  
12. Will you dispute with him concerning 
what he saw?  
13. He saw him on another descent.  
14. At the Lotus Tree of the Extremity.  
15. Near which is the Garden of Repose.  
16. As there covered the Lotus Tree what cov-
ered it.  
17. The sight did not waver, nor did it exceed.
