## 31.  LUQMAN   (Luqman)  
29. Have you not seen how Allah merges the 
night into the day, and merges the day into 
the night? That He subjected the sun and the 
moon, each running for a stated term? And 
that Allah is Cognizant of everything you do?  
30. That is because Allah is the Reality, and 
what they worship besides Him is falsehood, 
and because Allah is the Exalted, the Su-
preme.  
31. Have you not seen how the ships sail 
through the sea, by the grace of Allah, to 
show you of His wonders? In that are signs 
for every persevering, thankful person.  
32. When waves, like canopies, cover them, 
they call upon Allah, devoting their religion 
to Him. But when He has delivered them to 
dry land, some of them waver. No one re-
nounces Our revelat ions except the treacher-
ous blasphemer.  
33. O people! Be conscious of your Lord, and 
dread a Day when no parent can avail his child, nor can a child avail his parent, in any-
thing. The promise of Allah is true. There-
fore, do not let this life deceive you, n or let 
illusions deceive you regarding Allah.  
34. With Allah rests the knowledge of the 
Hour. He sends down the rain, and He knows what the wombs contain. No soul knows 
what it will reap tomorrow, and no soul 
knows in what land it will die. Allah is All-
Knowing, Well -Informed.  
  
## 32. PROSTRATION  (as-Sajdah ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Alif, Lam, Meem.  
2. The revelation of the Book, without a doubt, 
is from the Lord of the Universe.  
3. Yet they say, “He made it up.” In fact, it is 
the Truth from your Lord, to warn a people 
who received no warner before you, that they 
may be guided.  4. Allah is He who created the heavens and the 
earth and everything between them in six 
days, and then established Himself on the 
Throne. Apart from Him, you  have no mas-
ter and no intercessor. Will you not reflect?  
5. He regulates all affairs, from the heavens, to 
the earth. Then it ascends to Him on a Day 
the length of which is a thousand years by 
your count.  
6. That is the Knower of the Invisible and the 
Visible, the Powerful, the Merciful.   
7. He who perfected everything He created, 
and originated the creation of man from clay.  
8. Then made his reproduction from an ex-
tract of an insignificant fluid.  
9. Then He proportioned him, and breathed 
into him of His Spirit. Then He gave you the 
hearing, and the eyesight, and the brains —
but rarely do you give thanks.  
10. And they say, “When we are lost into the 
earth, shall we be in a new creation?” In fact, 
they deny the meeting with their Lord.  
11. Say, “The angel of death put in charge of 
you will reclaim you. Then to your Lord you 
will be returned.”  
12. If only you could see the guilty, bowing 
their heads before their Lord: “Our Lord, we 
have seen and we have heard, so send us back, 
and we will act righteously; we ar e now con-
vinced.”  
13. Had We willed, We could have given every 
soul its guidance, but the declaration from Me will come true: “I will fill Hell with jinn 
and humans, altogether.”  
14. So taste, because you forgot the meeting of 
this Day of yours; We have forgotten you; so 
taste the eternal torment for what you used to 
do. 
15. They believe in Our communications, 
those who, when reminded of them, fall 
down prostrate, and glorify their Lord with 
praise, and are not proud.  
16. Their sides shun their beds, as t hey pray to 
their Lord, out of reverence and hope; and 
from Our provisions to them, they give.
