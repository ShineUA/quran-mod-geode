## 16.  THE BEE   (an-Nahl)   
125. Invite to the way of your Lord with wis-
dom and good advice, and debate with them 
in the most dignified manner. Your Lord is 
aware of those who stray from His p ath, and 
He is aware of those who are guided.  
126. If you were to retaliate, retaliate to the 
same degree as the injury done to you. But if 
you resort to patience —it is better for the pa-
tient.  
127. So be patient. Your patience is solely from 
Allah. And do not grieve over them, and do 
not be stressed by their schemes.  
128. Allah is with those who are righteous and 
those who are virtuous.  
  
## 17. THE NIGHT JOURNEY  (al-Isra’ ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Glory to Him who journeyed His serv ant by 
night, from the Sacred Mosque, to the Far-
thest Mosque, whose precincts We have 
blessed, in order to show him of Our won-
ders. He is the Listener, the Beholder.  
2. And We gave Moses the Scripture, and 
made it a guide for the Children of Israel: Take none for protector other than Me.  
3. The descendants of those We carried with 
Noah. He was an appreciative servant.  
4. And We conveyed to the Children of Israel 
in the Scripture: You will commit evil on 
earth twice, and you will rise to a great height.  
5. When the first of the two promises came 
true, We sent against you servants of Ours, 
possessing great might, and they ransacked 
your homes. It was a promise fulfilled.  
6. Then We gave you back your turn against 
them, and supplied you with wealth and chil-
dren, and made you more numerous.  
7. If you work righteousness, you work right-
eousness for yourselves; and if you commit evil, you do so against yourselves. Then, 
when the second promise comes true, they 
will make your faces filled with sorrow, and enter the Temple as they entered it the first time, and utterly destroy all that falls into 
their power.  
8. Perhaps your Lord will have mercy on you. 
But if you revert, We will revert. We have 
made Hell a prison for the disbelievers.  
9. This Quran guides to what is most upright; 
and it gives good news to the believers who 
do good deeds, that they will have a great re-
ward.  
10. And those who do not believe in the Here-
after —We have prepared for them a painful 
punishment.  
11. The human being prays for evil as he prays 
for good. The human being is very hasty.  
12. We have made the night and the day two 
wonders. We erased the wonder of the night, 
and made the wonder of the day revealing, that you may seek bounty from your Lord, 
and know the numbe r of years, and the cal-
culation. We have explained all things in de-
tail. 
13. For every person We have attached his fate 
to his neck. And on the Day of Resurrection, 
We will bring out for him a book which he 
will find spread open.  
14. “Read your book; today  there will be none 
but yourself to call you to account.”  
15. Whoever is guided —is guided for his own 
good. And whoever goes astray —goes astray 
to his detriment. No burdened soul carries 
the burdens of another, nor do We ever pun-
ish until We have sent a me ssenger.  
16. When We decide to destroy a town, We 
command its affluent ones, they transgress in 
it, so the word becomes justified against it, 
and We destroy it completely.  
17. How many generations have We destroyed 
after Noah? Your Lord is sufficient as 
Knower and Beholder of the sins of his serv-
ants.  
18. Whoever desires the fleeting life, We expe-
dite for him what We decide to give him, to whomever We desire. Then We consign him
