## 28.  HISTORY   (al-Qasas)  
82. Those who had wished they were in his po-
sition the day before were saying, “Indeed, it 
is Allah who spreads the bounty to whomever 
He wills of His servants, and restricts it. Had 
Allah not been gracious to us, He would have 
caved in on us. No wonder the ungrateful 
never prosper.”  
83. That Home of the Hereafter —We assign it 
for those who seek no superiority on earth, 
nor corruption. And the outcome is for the 
cautious.  
84. Whoever brings a virtue will receive better 
than it. But whoever brings evil —the evildo-
ers will be rewarded only according to what they used to do.  
85. He Who ordained the Quran for you will 
return you Home. Say, “My Lord knows best 
who comes wi th guidance, and who is in 
manifest error.”  
86. You did not expect the Scripture to be 
transmitted to you, except as mercy from your Lord. Therefore, do not be a supporter 
of the disbelievers.  
87. And do not let them divert you from Al-
lah’s revelations aft er they have been revealed 
to you. And pray to your Lord, and never be of the polytheists.  
88. And do not invoke with Allah any other 
god. There is no god but He. All things per-
ish, except His presence. His is the judgment, 
and to Him you will be returned.  
  
## 29. THE SPIDER  (al-’Ankabut)  
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Alif, Lam, Meem.  
2. Have the people supposed that they will be 
left alone to say, “We believe,” without being 
put to the test?  
3. We have tested those before them. Allah 
will surely know the truthful, and He will 
surely know the liars.  4. Or do those who commit sins think they can 
fool Us? Terrible is their opinion!  
5. Whoever looks forward to the meeting with 
Allah —the appointed time of Allah is com-
ing. He is the All -Hear ing, the All -Knowing.  
6. Whoever strives, strives only for himself. 
Allah is Independent of the beings.  
7. Those who believe and do righteous 
deeds —We will remit their sins, and We will 
reward them according to the best of what they used to do.  
8. We have advised the human being to be 
good to his parents. But if they urge you to 
associate with Me something you have no knowledge of, do not obey them. To Me is 
your return; and I will inform you of what 
you used to do.  
9. Those who believe and do good works —We 
will admit them into the company of the 
righteous.  
10. Among the people is he who says, “We 
have believed in Allah.” Yet when he is harmed on Allah’s account, he equates the 
people's persecution with Allah’s retribution. 
And if help comes from your Lord, he says, 
“We were actually with you.” Is not Allah 
aware of what is inside the hearts of the peo-
ple? 
11. Allah certainly knows those who believe, 
and He certainly knows the hypocrites.  
12. Those who disbelieve say to those who be-
lieve, “Follow our way, and  we will carry your 
sins.” In no way can they carry any of their sins. They are liars.  
13. They will carry their own loads, and other 
loads with their own. And they will be ques-
tioned on the Day of Resurrection concern-
ing what they used to fabricate.  
14. We sent Noah to his people, and He stayed 
among them for a thousand years minus fifty 
years. Then the Deluge swept them; for they 
were wrongdoers.  
15. But We saved him, together with the com-
pany of the Ark, and We made it a sign for all peoples.
