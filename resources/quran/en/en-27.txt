## 3.  FAMILY OF IMRAN   (Ali ‘Imran)  
195. And so their Lord answered them: “I will 
not waste the work of any worker among you, 
whether male or female. You are one of an-
other. For those who emigrated, and were ex-
pelled from their homes, and were persecuted 
because of Me, and fought and were killed —
I will remit for them their sins, and will admit 
them into gardens beneath which rivers 
flow —a reward from Allah.  With Allah is the 
ultimate reward.”  
196. Do not be impressed by the disbelievers’ 
movements in the land.  
197. A brief enjoyment, then their abode is 
Hell. What a miserable resort.  
198. As for those who feared their Lord: for 
them will be gardens beneath w hich rivers 
flow, wherein they will abide forever —hospi-
tality from Allah. What Allah possesses is 
best for the just.  
199. Among the People of the Scripture are 
those who believe in Allah, and in what was 
revealed to you, and in what was revealed to 
them. T hey are humble before Allah, and 
they do not sell Allah’s revelations for a cheap 
price. These will have their reward with their 
Lord. Allah is swift in reckoning.  
200. O you who believe! Be patient, and advo-
cate patience, and be united, and revere Al-
lah, so that you may thrive.  
  
## 4. WOMEN  (an-Nisa’ ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. O people! Fear your Lord, who created you 
from a single soul, and created from it its 
mate, and propagated from them many men and women. And revere Allah whom  you ask 
about, and the parents. Surely, Allah is 
Watchful over you.  
2. And give orphans their properties, and do 
not substitute the bad for the good. And do 
not consume their properties by combining 
them with yours, for that would be a serious 
sin. 3. If you fear you cannot act fairly towards the 
orphans —then marry the women you like —
two, or three, or four. But if you fear you will 
not be fair, then one, or what you already 
have. That makes it more likely that you 
avoid bias.  
4. Give women their dowries gr aciously. But if 
they willingly forego some of it, then con-
sume it with enjoyment and pleasure.  
5. Do not give the immature your money 
which Allah has assigned to you for support. 
But provide for them from it, and clothe 
them, and speak to them with kind w ords.  
6. Test the orphans until they reach the age of 
marriage. If you find them to be mature 
enough, hand over their properties to them. And do not consume it extravagantly or hast-
ily before they grow up. The rich shall not 
charge any wage, but the poor m ay charge 
fairly. When you hand over their properties 
to them, have it witnessed for them. Allah 
suffices as a Reckoner.  
7. Men receive a share of what their parents 
and relatives leave, and women receive a 
share of what their parents and relatives 
leave; be it little or much —a legal share.  
8. If the distribution is attended by the rela-
tives, and the orphans, and the needy, give 
them something out of it, and speak to them 
kindly.  
9. Those who are concerned about the fate of 
their weak children, in case they  leave them 
behind, should fear Allah, and speak appro-priate words.  
10. Those who consume the wealth of orphans 
illicitly consume only fire into their bellies; 
and they will roast in a Blaze.  
11. Allah instructs you regarding your chil-
dren: The male receiv es the equivalent of the 
share of two females. If they are daughters, 
more than two, they get two- thirds of what he 
leaves. If there is only one, she gets one -half. 
As for the parents, each gets one -sixth of 
what he leaves, if he had children. If he had 
no children, and his parents inherit from
