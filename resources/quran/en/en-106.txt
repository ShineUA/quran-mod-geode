## 17.  THE NIGHT JOURNEY   (al-Isra’)   
93. Or you possess a house of gold. Or you as-
cend into the sky. Even then, we will not be-
lieve in your ascension, unless you bring 
down for us a book that we can read.” Say, 
“Glory be to my Lord. Am I anything but a 
human messenger?”  
94. Nothing prevented the people from believ-
ing, when guidance has come to them, except 
that they said, “Did Allah send a human mes-
senge r?” 
95. Say, “If there were angels on earth, walking 
around in peace, We would have sent down 
to them from heaven an angel messenger.”  
96. Say, “Allah is enough witness between you 
and me. He is fully aware of His servants, and He sees them well.”  
97. Whomever Allah guides is the guided one. 
And whomever He leaves astray —for them 
you will find no protectors apart from Him. 
And We will gather them on the Day of Res-
urrection, on their faces, blind, dumb, and 
deaf. Their abode is Hell; whenever it abates, 
We intensify the blaze for them.  
98. This is their repayment for having blas-
phemed against Our revelations, and having 
said, “Shall we, when we have become bones 
and fragments, be resurrected as a new crea-
tion?”  
99. Do they not consider that Allah, Who cre-
ated the heavens and the earth, is Able to cre-
ate the likes of them? He has assigned for them a term, in which there is no doubt. But 
the wrongdoers persist in denying the truth.  
100. Say, “If you possessed the treasuries of my 
Lord’s mercy, you would have  withheld them 
for fear of spending.” The human being has 
always been stingy.  
101. We gave Moses nine clear signs —ask the 
Children of Israel. When he went to them, 
Pharaoh said to him, “I think that you, Mo-
ses, are bewitched.”  
102. He said, “You know that none sent these 
down except the Lord of the heavens and the 
earth —eye openers; and I think that you, 
Pharaoh, are doomed.”  103. He resolved to scare them off the land, but 
We drowned him, and those with him, alto-
gether.  
104. After him, We said to the Child ren of Is-
rael, “Inhabit the land, and when the promise 
of the Hereafter arrives, We will bring you all 
together.”  
105. With the truth We sent it down, and with 
the truth it descended. We sent you only as a 
bearer of good news and a warner.  
106. A Quran whi ch We unfolded gradually, 
that you may recite to the people over time. And We revealed it in stages.  
107. Say, “Believe in it, or do not believe.” 
Those who were given knowledge before it, 
when it is recited to them, they fall to their 
chins, prostrating.  
108. And they say, “Glory to our Lord. The 
promise of our Lord is fulfilled.” 
109. And they fall to their chins, weeping, and 
it adds to their humility.  
110. Say, “Call Him Allah, or call Him the Most 
Merciful. Whichever name you use, to Him 
belong the Bes t Names.” And be neither loud 
in your prayer, nor silent in it, but follow a 
course in between.  
111. And say, “Praise be to Allah, who has not 
begotten a son, nor has He a partner in sov-
ereignty, nor has He an ally out of weakness, 
and glorify Him constant ly.” 
  
## 18. THE CAVE  (al-Kahf)  
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Praise be to Allah, who revealed the Book to 
His servant, and allowed in it no distortion.  
2. Valuable —to warn of severe punishment 
from Himself; and to deliver good news to the 
believers who do righteous deeds, that they 
will have an excellent reward.  
3. In which they will abide forever.
