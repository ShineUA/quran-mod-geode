Spirit from Him. So believe in Allah and His 
messengers, and do not say, “Three.” Re-
frain— it is better for you. Allah is only one 
God. Glory be to Him —that He should have 
a son. To Him belongs everything in the heavens and the earth, and Allah is a suffi-
cient Protector.  
172. The Messiah does not disdain to be a serv-
ant of Allah, nor do the favored angels. W ho-
ever disdains His worship, and is too arro-
gant —He will round them up to Himself al-
together.  
173. But as for those who believe and do good 
works, He will pay them their wages in full, and will increase His grace for them. But as for those who disdain and are too proud, He 
will punish them with an agonizing punish-ment. And they will find for themselves, 
apart from Allah, no lord and no savior.  
174. O people! A proof has come to you from 
your Lord, and We sent down to you a clear light.  
175. As for those who  believe in Allah, and hold 
fast to Him, He will admit them into mercy 
and grace from Him, and will guide them to 
Himself in a straight path.  
176. They ask you for a ruling. Say, “Allah gives 
you a ruling concerning the person who has 
neither parents nor c hildren.” If a man dies, 
and leaves no children, and he had a sister, 
she receives one- half of what he leaves. And 
he inherits from her if she leaves no children. 
But if there are two sisters, they receive two -
thirds of what he leaves. If the siblings are 
men and women, the male receives the share 
of two females.” Allah makes things clear for 
you, lest you err. Allah is Aware of every-
thing.  
  
## 5. THE TABLE  (al-Ma’idah ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. O you who believe! Fulfill your commit-
ments. Livestock animals are permitted for you, except those specified to you; but not 
wild game while you are in pilgrim sanctity. 
Allah decrees whatever He wills.  
2. O you who believe! Do not violate Allah’s 
sacraments, nor the Sacred Month, nor the offerings, nor the garlanded, nor those head-
ing for the Sacred House seeking blessings 
from their Lord and approval. When you 
have left the pilgrim sanctity, you may hunt. 
And let not the hatred of people who barred 
you from the Sacred Mosque incite you to ag-gression. And cooperate with one another in 
virtuous conduct and conscience, and do not cooperate with one another in sin and hostil-
ity. And fear Allah. Allah is severe in punish-
ment.  
3. Prohibited for you are carrion, blood, the 
flesh of swine, and animals  dedicated to other 
than Allah; also the flesh of animals stran-
gled, killed violently, killed by a fall, gored to 
death, mangled by wild animals —except 
what you rescue, and animals sacrificed on 
altars; and the practice of drawing lots. For it 
is immoral. Today, those who disbelieve have 
despaired of your religion, so do not fear 
them, but fear Me. Today I have perfected 
your religion for you, and have completed 
My favor upon you, and have approved Islam 
as a religion for you. But whoever is com-
pelled by hu nger, with no intent of wrongdo-
ing—Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  
4. They ask you what is permitted for them. 
Say, “Permitted for you are all good things, including what trained dogs and falcons catch for you.” You train them according to 
what Allah has taught you. So eat from what 
they catch for you, and pronounce Allah’s 
name over it. And fear Allah. Allah is Swift in 
reckoning.  
5. Today all good things are made lawful for 
you. And the food of those given the Scrip-
ture is lawful for you, and your food i s lawful 
for them. So are chaste believing women, and chaste women from the people who were 
given the Scripture before you, provided you 
give them their dowries, and take them in 
marriage, not in adultery, nor as mistresses. But whoever rejects faith, his work will be in
