## 46.  THE DUNES   (al-Ahqaf) 
was their lie, a fabrication of their  own mak-
ing. 
29. Recall when We dispatched towards you a 
number of jinn, to listen to the Quran. When 
they came in its presence, they said, “Pay at-
tention!” Then, when it was concluded, they rushed to their people, warning them.  
30. They said, “O our peopl e, we have heard a 
Scripture, sent down after Moses, confirming 
what came before it. It guides to the truth, 
and to a straight path.  
31. O our people! Answer the caller to Allah, 
and believe in Him; and He will forgive you 
your sins, and will save you from  a painful 
punishment.”  
32. He who does not answer the caller to Allah 
will not escape on earth, and has no protec-
tors besides Him. Those are in obvious error.  
33. Do they not realize that Allah, who created 
the heavens and the earth, and was never 
tired b y creating them, is Able to revive the 
dead? Yes indeed; He is Capable of every-
thing.  
34. On the Day when those who disbelieved 
are presented to the Fire: “Is this not real?” They will say, “Yes, indeed, by our Lord.” He 
will say, “Then taste the suffering  for having 
disbelieved.”  
35. So be patient, as the messengers with re-
solve were patient, and do not be hasty re-
garding them. On the Day when they witness 
what they are promised, it will seem as if they 
had lasted only for an hour of a day. A proc-
lamation:  Will any be destroyed except the 
sinful people?  
  
## 47. MUHAMMAD  (Muhammad ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Those who disbelieve and repel from the 
path of Allah— He nullifies their works.  
2. While those who believe, and work right-
eousness, and believe in what was sent down to Muhammad —and it is the truth from their 
Lord —He remits their sins, and relieves their 
concerns.  
3. That is because those who disbelieve follow 
falsehoods, while those who believe follow 
the truth from the ir Lord. Allah thus cites for 
the people their examples.  
4. When you encounter those who disbelieve, 
strike at their necks. Then, when you have routed them, bind them firmly. Then, either 
release them by grace, or by ransom, until 
war lays down its burdens . Had Allah willed, 
He could have defeated them Himself, but He 
thus tests some of you by means of others. As 
for those who are killed in the way of Allah, 
He will not let their deeds go to waste.  
5. He will guide them, and will improve their 
state of mind . 
6. And will admit them into Paradise, which 
He has identified for them.  
7. O you who believe! If you support Allah, He 
will support you, and will strengthen your 
foothold.  
8. But as for those who disbelieve, for them is 
perdition, and He will waste their  deeds.  
9. That is because they hated what Allah re-
vealed, so He nullified their deeds.  
10. Have they not journeyed through the earth 
and seen the consequences for those before 
them? Allah poured destruction upon them, and for the unbelievers is something compa-
rable.  
11. That is because Allah is the Master of those 
who believe, while the disbelievers have no 
master.  
12. Allah will admit those who believe and do 
good deeds into gardens beneath which riv-
ers flow. As for those who disbelieve, they en-joy themse lves, and eat as cattle eat, and the 
Fire will be their dwelling.  
13. How many a town was more powerful than 
your town which evicted you? We destroyed 
them, and there was no helper for them.  
14. Is he who stands upon evidence from his 
Lord, like someone whose evil deed is made
