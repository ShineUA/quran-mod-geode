## 19.  MARY   (Maryam)  
71. There is not one of you but will go down to 
it. This has been an unavoidable decree of 
your Lord.  
72. Then We will rescue those who were d e-
vout, and leave the wrongdoers in it, on their 
knees.  
73. When Our clear revelations are recited to 
them, those who disbelieve say to those who 
believe, “Which of the two parties is better in 
position, and superior in influence?”  
74. How many a generation  have We de-
stroyed before them, who surpassed them in riches and splendor?  
75. Say, “Whoever is in error, the Most Merci-
ful will lead him on.” Until, when they see 
what they were promised —either the punish-
ment, or the Hour. Then they will know who 
was in w orse position and weaker in forces.  
76. Allah increases in guidance those who ac-
cept guidance. And the things that endure —
the righteous deeds —have the best reward 
with your Lord, and the best outcome.  
77. Have you seen him who denied Our reve-
lations, and said, “I will be given wealth and 
children”?  
78. Did he look into the future, or did he re-
ceive a promise from the Most Merciful?  
79. No indeed! We will write what he says, and 
will keep extending the agony for him.  
80. Then We will inherit from him what h e 
speaks of, and he will come to Us alone.  
81. And they took, besides Allah, other gods, 
to be for them a source of strength.  
82. By no means! They will reject their worship 
of them, and become opponents to them.  
83. Have you not considered how We dispatch  
the devils against the disbelievers, exciting them with incitement?  
84. So do not hurry against them. We are 
counting for them a countdown.  
85. On the Day when We will gather the right-
eous to the Most Merciful, as guests.  
86. And herd the sinners into hell, like animals 
to water.  87. They will have no power of intercession, 
except for someone who has an agreement 
with the Most Merciful.  
88. And they say, “The Most Merciful has be-
gotten a son.”  
89. You have come up with something mon-
strous.  
90. At which the heavens almost rupture, and 
the earth splits, and the mountains fall and 
crumble.  
91. Because they attribute a son to the Most 
Merciful.  
92. It is not fitting for the Most Merciful to 
have a son.  
93. There is none in the heavens and the earth 
but will come to the Most Merciful as a serv-
ant. 
94. He has enumerated them, and counted 
them one by one.  
95. And each one of them will come to Him on 
the Day of Resurrection alone.  
96. Those who believe and do righteous deeds, 
the Most Merciful will give them lov e. 
97. We made it easy in your tongue, in order 
to deliver good news to the righteous, and to warn with it a hostile people.  
98. How many a generation have We de-
stroyed before them? Can you feel a single 
one of them, or hear from them the slightest 
whisper ? 
  
## 20. TA-HA (Ta-Ha) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Ta, Ha.  
2. We did not reveal the Quran to you to make 
you suffer.  
3. But only as a reminder for him who fears.  
4. A revelation from He who created the earth 
and the high heavens.
