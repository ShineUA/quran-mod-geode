## 69. THE REALITY  (al-Haqqah ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. The Reality.  
2. What is the Reality?  
3. What will make you understand what the 
Reality is?  
4. Thamood and Aad denied the Catastrophe.  
5. As for Thamood, they were annihilated by 
the Overwhelming.  
6. And as for Aad; they were annihilated by a 
furious, roaring w ind. 
7. He unleashed it upon them for seven nights 
and eight days, in succession. You could see 
the people tossed around, as though they 
were stumps of hollow palm -trees.  
8. Can you see any remnant of them?  
9. Then Pharaoh came, and those before him, 
and t he Overturned Cities steeped in sin.  
10. But they disobeyed the messenger of their 
Lord, so He seized them with an overpower-
ing grip.  
11. When the waters overflowed, We carried 
you in the cruising ship.  
12. To make it a lesson for you —so that retain-
ing ear s may retain it.  
13. Then, when the Trumpet is sounded a sin-
gle time.  
14. And the earth and the mountains are lifted 
up, and crushed, with a single crush.  
15. On that Day, the Event will come to pass.  
16. And the heaven will crack; so on that Day 
it will  be frail.  
17. And the angels will be ranged around its 
borders, while eight will be carrying the Throne of your Lord above them that Day.  
18. On that Day you will be exposed, and no 
secret of yours will remain hidden.  19. As for him who is given his book in his 
right hand, he will say, “Here, take my book 
and read it.  
20. I knew I would be held accountable.”  
21. So he will be in pleasant living.  
22. In a lofty Garden.  
23. Its pickings are within reach.  
24. “Eat and drink merrily for what you did in 
the days gone by.”  
25. But as for him who is given his book in his 
left hand, he will say, “I wish I was never 
given my book.  
26. And never knew what my account was.  
27. If only it was the end.  
28. My money cannot avail me.  
29. My power has vanished from me.”  
30. “Take him and shackle him.  
31. Then scorch him in the Blaze.  
32. Then in a chain which length is seventy cu-
bits tie him up.  
33. For he would not believe in Allah the 
Great.  
34. Nor would he advocate the feeding of the 
destitute.  
35. So he has no friend  here today.  
36. And no food except scum.  
37. Which only the sinners eat.”  
38. Indeed, I swear by what you see.  
39. And by what you do not see.  
40. It is the speech of a noble messenger.  
41. And it is not the speech of a poet— little do 
you believe.  
42. Nor is it the speech of a soothsayer —little 
do you take heed.  
43. It is a revelation from the Lord of the 
Worlds.  
44. Had he falsely attributed some statements 
to Us.  
45. We would have seized him by the right 
arm.
