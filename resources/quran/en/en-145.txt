## 27.  THE ANT   (an-Nam l) 
clouds —the making of Allah, who has per-
fecte d everything. He is fully Informed of 
what you do.  
89. Whoever brings a virtue will receive better 
than it —and they will be safe from the hor-
rors of that Day.  
90. But whoever brings evil —their faces will be 
tumbled into the Fire. Will you be rewarded 
excep t for what you used to do?  
91. “I was commanded to worship the Lord of 
this town, who has sanctified it, and to 
Whom everything belongs; and I was com-
manded to be of those who submit.  
92. And to recite the Quran.” Whoever is 
guided —is guided to his own adv antage. And 
whoever goes astray, then say, “I am one of the warners.”  
93. And say, “Praise belongs to Allah; He will 
show you His signs, and you will recognize 
them. Your Lord is not heedless of what you 
do.” 
  
## 28. HISTORY  (al-Qasas ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Ta, Seen, Meem.  
2. These are the Verses of the Clear Book.  
3. We narrate to you from the history of Mo-
ses and Pharaoh —in truth— for people who 
believe.  
4. Pharaoh exalted himself in the land, and di-
vided its people into faction s. He persecuted 
a group of them, slaughtering their sons, 
while sparing their daughters. He was truly a 
corrupter.  
5. But We desired to favor those who were op-
pressed in the land, and to make them lead-
ers, and to make them the inheritors.  
6. And to establ ish them in the land; and to 
show Pharaoh, Hamaan, and their troops, the 
very thing they feared.  7. We inspired the mother of Moses: “Nurse 
him; then, when you fear for him, cast him 
into the river, and do not fear, nor grieve; We 
will return him to you, and make him one of 
the messengers.”  
8. Pharaoh’s household picked him up, to be 
an opponent and a sorrow for them. Pharaoh, Hamaan, and their troops were sinners.  
9. Pharaoh’s wife said, “An eye's delight for me 
and for you. Do not kill him; perhaps he will 
be useful to us, or we may adopt him as a 
son.” But they did not foresee.  
10. The heart of Moses’ mother became vacant. 
She was about to disclose him, had We not 
steadied her heart, that she may remain a be-
liever.  
11. She said to his sister, “Trail hi m.” So she 
watched him from afar, and they were una-
ware.  
12. We forbade him breastfeeding at first. So 
she said, “Shall I tell you about a family that can raise him for you, and will look after 
him?”  
13. Thus We returned him to his mother, that 
she may be comforted, and not grieve, and 
know that Allah’s promise is true. But most of them do not know.  
14. And when he reached his maturity, and be-
came established, We gave him wisdom and 
knowledge. Thus do We reward the virtuous.  
15. Once he entered the city, un noticed by its 
people. He found in it two men fighting —one 
of his own sect, and one from his enemies. 
The one of his sect solicited his assistance 
against the one from his enemies; so Moses 
punched him, and put an end to him. He said, 
“This is of Satan's d oing; he is an enemy that 
openly misleads.”  
16. He said, “My Lord, I have wronged myself, 
so forgive me.” So He forgave him. He is the 
Forgiver, the Merciful.  
17. He said, “My Lord, in as much as you have 
favored me, I will never be a supporter of the 
crim inals.”
