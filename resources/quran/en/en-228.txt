## 76. MAN  (al-Insan)    
20. Wherever you look, you see bliss, and a 
vast kingdom.  
21. Upon them are garments of green silk, and 
satin. And they will be adorned with bracelets 
of silver. And thei r Lord will offer them a 
pure drink.  
22. “This is a reward for you. Your efforts are 
well appreciated.”  
23. It is We who sent down the Quran upon 
you—a gradual revelation.  
24. So be patient for the decision of your Lord, 
and do not obey the sinner or the blasphemer among them.  
25. And mention the Name of your Lord, 
morning and evening.  
26. And for part of the night, prostrate yourself 
to Him, and glorify Him long into the night.  
27. As for these: they love the fleeting life, and 
leave behind a Heavy Day.  
28. We created them, and strengthened their 
frame; and whenever We will, We can replace 
them with others like them.  
29. This is a reminder; so whoever wills, let 
him take a path to his Lord.  
30. Yet you cannot will, unless Allah wills. Al-
lah is Knowing and Wise.  
31. He admits into His mercy whomever He 
wills. But as for the wrongdoers, He has pre-
pared for them a painful punishment.  
  
## 77. THE UNLEASHED  (al-Mursalat ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. By those unleashed in succession.  
2. Storm ing turbulently.  
3. Scattering far and wide.  
4. Separating decisively.  
5. Delivering a message.  
6. Excusing or warning.  
7. Surely what you are promised will happen.  8. When the stars are obliterated.  
9. And the sky is fractured.  
10. And the mountains are b lown away.  
11. And the messengers are alerted.  
12. Until which day is it deferred?  
13. Until the Day of Decision.  
14. And what will teach you what the Day of 
Decision is?  
15. Woe on that Day to the liars.  
16. Did We not destroy the ancients?  
17. Then succeeded them with the others?  
18. This is how We deal with the guilty.  
19. Woe on that Day to the rejecters.  
20. Did We not create you from an insignifi-
cant fluid?  
21. Then lodged it in a secure place?  
22. For a known term?  
23. We measured precisely. We are the best to 
measure.  
24. Woe on that Day to the falsifiers.  
25. Did We not make the earth a homestead?  
26. For the living and the dead?  
27. And set on it lofty mountains, and given 
you pure water to drink?  
28. Woe on that Day to the deniers.  
29. “Proce ed to what you used to deny.”  
30. “Proceed to a shadow of three different 
masses.”  
31. Offering no shade, and unavailing against 
the flames.  
32. It shoots sparks as castles.  
33. As if they were yellow camels.  
34. Woe on that Day to the liars.  
35. This is a Day when they will not speak.  
36. And they will not be allowed to apologize.  
37. Woe on that Day to the rejecters.  
38. This is the Day of Separation; We have 
gathered you, together with the ancients.
