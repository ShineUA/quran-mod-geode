## 63. THE HYPOCRITES  (al-Munafiqun)  
7. It is they who say: “Do not spend anything 
on those who side with Allah’s Messenger, 
unless they have dispersed.” To Allah belong 
the treasures of the heavens and the earth, but 
the hypocrites do not understand.  
8. They say, “If we return to the City, the more 
powerful therein will evict the weak.” But 
power belongs to Allah, and His Messenger, 
and the believers; but the hypocrites do not know.  
9. O you who believe! Let neither your posses-
sions nor your children distract you from the 
remembrance of Allah. Whoever does that—
these are the losers.  
10. And give from what We have provided for 
you, before death approaches one of you, and 
he says, “My Lord, if only You would delay 
me for a short while, so that I may be charita-
ble, and be one of the righteous.”  
11. But Allah will not delay a soul when its time 
has come. Allah is Informed of what you do.  
  
## 64. GATHERING  (at-Taghabun ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Everything in the heavens and the earth 
praises Allah. To Him belongs the Kingdom, 
and to Him all praise is due, and He is Able 
to do all things.  
2. It is He who created you. Some of you are 
unbelievers, and some of you are believers. 
And Allah perceives what you do.  
3. He created the heavens and the earth with 
truth, and He designed you, and designed 
you well, and to Him is the final return.  
4. He knows everything in the heavens and the 
earth, and He knows what you conceal and 
what you reveal. And Allah knows what is 
within the hearts.  
5. Has the news not reached you, of those who 
disbelieved before? They tasted the ill conse-
quences of their conduct, and a painful tor-
ment awaits them.  6. That is because their messengers came to 
them with clear explanations, but they said, 
“Are human beings going to guide us?” So 
they disbelieved and turned away. But Allah 
is in no need. Allah is Independent and 
Praiseworthy.  
7. Those who disbelieve claim that they will 
not be resurrected. Say, “Yes indeed, by my 
Lord, you will be resurrected; then you will be 
informed of everything you did; and that is 
easy for Allah.”  
8. So believe in Allah and His Messenger, and 
the Light which We sent d own. Allah is 
Aware of everything you do.  
9. The Day when He gathers you for the Day 
of Gathering —that is the Day of Mutual Ex-
change. Whoever believes in Allah and acts 
with integrity, He will remit his misdeeds, 
and will admit him into gardens beneath 
which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. 
That is the supreme achievement.  
10. But as for those who disbelieve and de-
nounce Our revelations —these are the in-
mates of the Fire, dwelling therein forever; 
and what a miserable fate!  
11. No disaster occurs excep t by Allah’s leave. 
Whoever believes in Allah, He guides his 
heart. Allah is Aware of everything.  
12. So obey Allah, and obey the Messenger. But 
if you turn away —it is only incumbent on 
Our Messenger to deliver the clear message.  
13. Allah, there is no god  but He; and in Allah 
let the believers put their trust.  
14. O you who believe! Among your wives and 
your children are enemies to you, so beware 
of them. But if you pardon, and overlook, and 
forgive —Allah is Forgiver and Merciful.  
15. Your possessions and your children are a 
test, but with Allah is a splendid reward.  
16. So be conscious of Allah as much as you 
can, and listen, and obey, and give for your 
own good. He who is protected from his stin-
giness —these are the prosperous.
