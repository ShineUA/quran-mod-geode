## 57. IRON  (al-Hadid` )  
nesses with their Lord; they will have their re-
ward and their light. But as for those who dis-
believe and deny Our revelations —these are 
the inmates of the Blaze.  
20. Know that the worldly l ife is only play, and 
distraction, and glitter, and boasting among you, and rivalry in wealth and children. It is 
like a rainfall that produces plants, and de-
lights the disbelievers. But then it withers, 
and you see it yellowing, and then it becomes 
debris . While in the Hereafter there is severe 
agony, and forgiveness from Allah, and ac-
ceptance. The life of this world is nothing but 
enjoyment of vanity.  
21. Race towards forgiveness from your Lord; 
and a Garden as vast as the heavens and the 
earth, prepared for those who believe in Allah 
and His messengers. That is the grace of Al-
lah; He bestows it on whomever He wills. Al-
lah is the Possessor of Immense Grace.  
22. No calamity occurs on earth, or in your 
souls, but it is in a Book, even before We 
make it happe n. That is easy for Allah.  
23. That you may not sorrow over what eludes 
you, nor exult over what He has given you. Allah does not love the proud snob.  
24. Those who are stingy, and induce people to 
be stingy. Whoever turns away —Allah is the 
Independent, th e Praiseworthy.  
25. We sent Our messengers with the clear 
proofs, and We sent down with them the 
Book and the Balance, that humanity may 
uphold justice. And We sent down iron, in 
which is violent force, and benefits for hu-
manity. That Allah may know who su pports 
Him and His messengers invisibly. Allah is 
Strong and Powerful.  
26. We sent Noah and Abraham, and estab-
lished in their line Prophethood and the 
Scripture. Some of them are guided, but 
many of them are sinners.  
27. Then We sent in their wake Our mess en-
gers, and followed up with Jesus son of Mary, 
and We gave him the Gospel, and instilled in 
the hearts of those who followed him com-passion and mercy. But as for the monasti-
cism which they invented —We did not or-
dain it for them —only to seek Allah’s ap-
prov al. But they did not observe it with its 
due observance. So We gave those of them 
who believed their reward, but many of them 
are sinful.  
28. O you who believe! Fear Allah, and believe 
in His Messenger: He will give you a double 
portion of His mercy, and will give you a light 
by which you walk, and will forgive you. Al-
lah is Forgiving and Merciful.  
29. That the People of the Book may know that 
they have no power whatsoever over Allah’s 
grace, and that all grace is in Allah’s hand; He gives it to whomever H e wills. Allah is Pos-
sessor of Great Grace.  
  
## 58. THE ARGUMENT  (al-Mujadilah ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Allah has heard the statement of she who 
argued with you concerning her husband, as 
she complained to Allah. Allah heard your 
conversation. Allah is Hearing and Seeing.  
2. Those of you who estrange their wives by 
equating them with their mothers —they are 
not their mothers. Their mothers are none 
else but those who gave birth to them. What 
they say is evil, and a blatant lie. But Allah is 
Pardoning and Forgiving.  
3. Those who estrange their wives by equating 
them with their mothers, then go back on what they said, must set free a slave before 
they may touch one another. To this you are 
exhorted, and Allah is well aware of what you 
do. 
4. But whoever cannot find the means must 
fast for two consecutive months before they 
may touch one another. And if he is unable, 
then the feeding of sixty needy people. This, 
in order that you affirm your faith in Allah 
and His Messenger. These are th e ordinances
