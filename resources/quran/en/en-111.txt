## 18.  THE CAVE   (al-Kahf)  
people who could barely understand what is 
said.  
94. They said, “O Zul -Qarnain, the Gog and 
Magog are spreading chaos in the land. Can 
we pay you, to build between us and them a 
wall?”  
95. He said, “What my Lord has empowered 
me with  is better. But assist me with strength, 
and I will build between you and them a dam.”  
96. “Bring me blocks of iron.” So that, when he 
had leveled up between the two cliffs, he said, 
“Blow.” And having turned it into a fire, he 
said, “Bring me tar to pour over it.”  
97. So they were unable to climb it, and they 
could not penetrate it.  
98. He said, “This is a mercy from my Lord. 
But when the promise of my Lord comes true, 
He will turn it into rubble, and the promise 
of my Lord is always true.”  
99. On that Day , We will leave them surging 
upon one another. And the Trumpet will be 
blown, and We will gather them together.  
100. On that Day, We will present the disbe-
lievers to Hell, all displayed.  
101. Those whose eyes were screened to My 
message, and were unable to  hear.  
102. Do those who disbelieve think that they 
can take My servants for masters instead of 
Me? We have prepared Hell for the hospital-
ity of the faithless.  
103. Say, “Shall We inform you of the greatest 
losers in their works?”  
104. “Those whose efforts  in this world are 
misguided, while they assume that they are doing well.”  
105. It is they who rejected the communica-
tions of their Lord, and the encounter with 
Him. So their works are in vain. And on the 
Day of Resurrection, We will consider them 
of no we ight.  
106. That is their requital —Hell —on account 
of their disbelief, and their taking My revela-
tions and My messengers in mockery.  107. As for those who believe and do righteous 
deeds, they will have the Gardens of Paradise 
for hospitality.  
108. Abiding t herein forever, without desiring 
any change therefrom.  
109. Say, “If the ocean were ink for the words 
of my Lord, the ocean would run out, before 
the words of my Lord run out,” even if We 
were to bring the like of it in addition to it.  
110. Say, “I am only  a human being like you, 
being inspired that your god is One God. 
Whoever hopes to meet his Lord, let him 
work righteousness, and never associate any-
one with the service of his Lord.”  
  
## 19. MARY  (Maryam)  
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Kaf, Ha, Ya, Ayn, Saad.  
2. A mention of the mercy of your Lord to-
wards His servant Zechariah.  
3. When he called on his Lord, a call in seclu-
sion.  
4. He said, “My Lord, my bones have become 
feeble, and my hair is aflame with gray, and 
never, Lord, have I be en disappointed in my 
prayer to you.  
5. “And I fear for my dependents after me, and 
my wife is barren. So grant me, from Your-
self, an heir.  
6. To inherit me, and inherit from the House 
of Jacob, and make him, my Lord, pleasing.”  
7. “O Zechariah, We give yo u good news of a 
son, whose name is John, a name We have never given before.”  
8. He said, “My Lord, how can I have a son, 
when my wife is barren, and I have become 
decrepit with old age?”  
9. He said, “It will be so, your Lord says, ‘it is 
easy for me, and I created you before, when 
you were nothing.’”
