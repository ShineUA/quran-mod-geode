## 71. NOAH  (Nuh ) 
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Say, “It was revealed to me that a band of 
jinn listened in, and said, ‘We have heard a 
wondrous Quran.  
2. It guides to rectitude, so we have believed in 
it; and we will never associate anyone with 
our Lord.  
3. And Exalted is the Grandeur of our Lord —
He never had a mate, nor a child.  
4. But the fools among us used to say nonsense 
about Allah.  
5. And we thought that humans and jinn 
would never utter lies about Allah.  
6. Some indi vidual humans used to seek 
power through some individual jinn, but they 
only increased them in confusion.  
7. They thought, as you thought, that Allah 
would never resurrect anyone.  
8. We probed the heaven, and found it filled 
with stern guards and projectil es. 
9. We used to take up positions to listen in; but 
whoever listens now finds a projectile in wait 
for him.  
10. We do not know whether ill is intended for 
those on earth, or if their Lord intends good-
ness for them.  
11. Some of us are righteous, but some of us are 
less than that; we follow divergent paths.  
12. We realized that we cannot defeat Allah on 
earth, and that we cannot escape Him by flee-
ing. 
13. And when we heard the guidance, we be-
lieved in it. Whoever believes in his Lord 
fears neither loss, nor  burden.  
14. Among us are those who are submitting, 
and among us are the compromisers. As for 
those who have submitted —it is they who 
pursue rectitude.  
15. But as for the compromisers —they will be 
firewood for Hell.’”  
16. Had they kept true to the Path, We  would 
have given them plenty water to drink.  17. To test them with it. Whoever turns away 
from the remembrance of his Lord, He will 
direct him to torment ever mounting.  
18. The places of worship are for Allah. So do 
not call, besides Allah, upon anyone el se. 
19. And when the servant of Allah got up call-
ing on Him, they almost fell on him in a mass.  
20. Say, “I pray only to my Lord, and I never 
associate anyone with Him.”  
21. Say, “It is not in my power to harm you, nor 
to bring you to right conduct.”  
22. Say, “No one can protect me from Allah, 
and I will not find any refuge except with 
Him.  
23. Except for a proclamation from Allah and 
His messages. He who defies Allah and His Messenger —for him is the Fire of Hell, in 
which they will dwell forever.”  
24. Until, when they see what they were prom-
ised, they will know who is weaker in helpers, 
and fewer in numbers.  
25. Say, “I do not know whether what you are 
promised is near, or whether my Lord will ex-tend it for a period.”  
26. The Knower of the Invisible; He do es not 
disclose His Invisible to anyone.  
27. Except to a Messenger of His choosing. He 
then dispatches guards before him and be-
hind him.  
28. That He may know that they have con-
veyed the messages of their Lord. He encom-
passes what they have, and has tallied  every-
thing by number.  
  
## 73. THE ENWRAPPED  (al-Muzzammil ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. O you Enwrapped one.  
2. Stay up during the night, except a little.  
3. For half of it, or reduce it a little.
