## 2.  THE HEIFER   (al-Baqarah)  
mentally deficient, or weak, or unable to dic-
tate, then let his guardian dictate with hon-
esty. And call to witness two men from 
among you. If two men are not available, then 
one man and two women whose testimony is 
acceptable to all —if one of them fails to re-
member, the other would remind her. Wit-
nesses must not refuse when called upon. 
And do not think it too trivial to write down, 
whether small or large, including the time of repayment. That is more equitable with Al-
lah, and stronger as evidence, and more likely 
to prevent doubt— except in the case of a spot 
transaction between you —then there is no 
blame on you if you do not write it down. 
And let there be witnesses whenever you con-
clude a contract, and let no harm be done to 
either scribe or witness. If you do that, it is 
corruption on your part. And fear Allah. Al-
lah teaches you. Allah is aware of everything.  
283. If you are on a journey, and cannot find a 
scribe, then a security deposit should be 
handed over. But if you trust one another, let the trustee fulfill his trust, and let him fear Al-
lah, his Lord. And do not conceal testimony. 
Whoever conc eals it is sinner at heart. Allah 
is aware of what you do.  
284. To Allah belongs everything in the heav-
ens and the earth. Whether you reveal what is within your selves, or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it. He forgives whom 
He wills, and He  punishes whom He wills. 
Allah is Able to do all things.  
285. The Messenger has believed in what was 
revealed to him from his Lord, as did the be-lievers. They all have believed in Allah, and 
His angels, and His scriptures, and His mes-
sengers: “We make no d istinction between 
any of His messengers.” And they say, “We hear and we obey. Your forgiveness, our 
Lord. To you is the destiny.”  
286. Allah does not burden any soul beyond its 
capacity. To its credit is what it earns, and 
against it is what it commits. “ Our Lord, do 
not condemn us if we forget or make a mis-
take. Our Lord, do not burden us as You have 
burdened those before us. Our Lord, do not 
burden us with more than we have strength to bear; and pardon us, and forgive us, and have mercy on us. You are ou r Lord and Mas-
ter, so help us against the disbelieving peo-
ple.”  
  
## 3. FAMILY OF IMRAN  (Ali ‘Imran ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Alif, Lam, Meem.  
2. Allah, there is no god but He, the Living, the 
Eternal.  
3. He sent down to you the Book with the 
Truth, confirming what came before it; and 
He sent down the Torah and the Gospel.  
4. Aforetime, as guidance for mankind; and 
He sent down the Criterion. Those who have rejected Allah’s signs will have a severe pun-
ishment. Allah is Mighty, Abl e to take re-
venge.  
5. Nothing is hidden from Allah, on earth or 
in the heaven.  
6. It is He who forms you in the wombs as He 
wills. There is no god except He, the Al-
mighty, the Wise.  
7. It is He who revealed to you the Book. Some 
of its verses are definitive; they are the foun-
dation of the Book, and others are unspecific. 
As for those in whose hearts is deviation, they 
follow the unspecific part, seeking descent, 
and seeking to derive an interpretation. But 
none knows its interpretation except Allah  
and those firmly rooted in knowledge say, 
“We believe in it; all is from our Lord.” But 
none recollects except those with under-
standing.  
8. “Our Lord, do not cause our hearts to 
swerve after You have guided us, and bestow 
on us mercy from Your presence; Y ou are the 
Giver.”  
9. “Our Lord, You will gather the people for a 
Day in which there is no doubt.” Allah will 
never break His promise.
