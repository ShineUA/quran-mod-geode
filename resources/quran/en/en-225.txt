## 73. THE ENWRAPPED  (al-Muzzammil ) 
4. Or add to it; and chant the Quran rhythmi-
cally.  
5. We are about to give you a heavy message.  
6. The vigil of night is more effective, and bet-
ter suited for recitation.  
7. In the daytime, you have lengthy work to 
do. 
8. So remember the Name of your Lord, and 
devote yourself to Him wholehear tedly.  
9. Lord of the East and the West. There is no 
god but He, so take Him as a Trustee.  
10. And endure patiently what they say, and 
withdraw from them politely.  
11. And leave Me to those who deny the truth, 
those of luxury, and give them a brief respite . 
12. With Us are shackles, and a Fierce Fire.  
13. And food that chokes, and a painful pun-
ishment.  
14. On the Day when the earth and the moun-
tains tremble, and the mountains become 
heaps of sand.  
15. We have sent to you a messenger, a witness 
over you, as We sent to Pharaoh a messenger.  
16. But Pharaoh defied the Messenger, so We 
seized him with a terrible seizing.  
17. So how will you, if you persist in unbelief, 
save yourself from a Day which will turn the 
children gray -haired?  
18. The heaven will shatter thereby. His prom-
ise is always fulfilled.  
19. This is a reminder. So whoever wills, let 
him take a path to his Lord.  
20. Your Lord knows that you stay up nearly 
two- thirds of the night, or half of it, or one -
third of it, along with a group of those with 
you. Allah designed the night and the day. He 
knows that you are unable to sustain it, so He has pardoned you. So read of the Quran what 
is possible for you. He knows that some of 
you may be ill; and others travelling through 
the land, seeking Allah’s bounty ; and others 
fighting in Allah’s cause. So read of it what is 
possible for you, and observe the prayers, and give regular charity, and lend Allah a gener-
ous loan. Whatever good you advance for 
yourselves, you will find it with Allah, better 
and generously rewarded. And seek Allah’s 
forgiveness, for Allah is Forgiving and Mer-
ciful.  
  
## 74. THE ENROBED  (al-Muddathir ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. O you Enrobed one.  
2. Arise and warn.  
3. And magnify your Lord.  
4. And purify your clothes.  
5. And abandon abominations.  
6. And show no favor seeking gain.  
7. And be constant for your Lord.  
8. When the Trumpet is blown.  
9. That Day will be a difficult day.  
10. For the disbelievers —not easy.  
11. Leave Me to him whom I created alone.  
12. And gave him  vast wealth.  
13. And children as witnesses.  
14. And smoothed things for him.  
15. Then he wants Me to add yet more!  
16. By no means! He was stubborn towards 
Our revelations.  
17. I will exhaust him increasingly.  
18. He thought and analyzed.  
19. May he perish, how he analyzed.  
20. Again: may he perish, how he analyzed.  
21. Then he looked.  
22. Then he frowned and whined.  
23. Then he turned back and was proud.  
24. And said, “This is nothing but magic from 
the past.  
25. This is nothing but the word of a mor tal.”
