## 26.  THE POETS   (ash-Shu’ara’)  
99. No one misled us except the sinners.  
100. Now we have no intercessors.  
101. And no sincere friend.  
102. If only we could have another chance, we 
would be among the faithful.”  
103. Surely in this is a sign, but most of them 
are not believers . 
104. Your Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.  
105. The people of Noah disbelieved the mes-
sengers.  
106. Their brother Noah said to them, “Do you 
not fear?  
107. I am to you a faithful messenger.  
108. So fear Allah, and obey me.  
109. I ask of you no payment for this. My pay-
ment is only from the Lord of the Worlds.  
110. So fear Allah, and obey me.”  
111. They said, “Shall we believe in you, when 
it is the lowliest who follow you?”  
112. He said, “What do I know about what they 
do? 
113. Their account rests only with my Lord, if 
you have sense.  
114. And I am not about to drive away the be-
lievers.  
115. I am only a clear warner.”  
116. They said, “If you do not refrain, O Noah, 
you will be stoned.”  
117. He said, “My Lord, my people have denied 
me. 
118. So judge between me and them decisively, 
and deliver me and the believers who are with 
me. 
119. So We delivered him and those with him 
in the laden Ark.  
120. Then We drowned the rest.  
121. In that is a sign, but most of them are not 
believers.  
122. Your Lord is the  Almighty, the Merciful.  
123. Aad disbelieved the messengers.  124. When their brother Hud said to them, “Do 
you not fear?  
125. I am to you a faithful messenger.  
126. So fear Allah, and obey me.  
127. I ask of you no payment for this. My pay-
ment is only from  the Lord of the Worlds.  
128. Do you build a monument on every height 
for vanity's sake?  
129. And you set up fortresses, hoping to live 
forever?  
130. And when you strike, you strike merci-
lessly?  
131. So fear Allah, and obey me.  
132. And reverence Him, who supplied you 
with everything you know.  
133. He supplied you with livestock and chil-
dren.  
134. And gardens and springs.  
135. I fear for you the punishment of an awe-
some Day.”  
136. They said, “It is the same for us, whether 
you lecture us, or do not lecture . 
137. This is nothing but morals of the ancients.  
138. And we will not be punished.” 
139. So they denied him, and We destroyed 
them. Surely in this is a sign, but most of 
them are not believers.  
140. Your Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.  
141. Thamood d isbelieved the messengers.  
142. When their brother Saleh said to them, 
“Do you not fear?  
143. I am to you a faithful messenger.  
144. So fear Allah, and obey me.  
145. I ask of you no payment for it. My pay-
ment is only from the Lord of the Worlds.  
146. Will you be left secure in what is here?  
147. In gardens and springs?  
148. And fields, and palm -trees whose fruits 
are delicious?
