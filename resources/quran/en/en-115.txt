## 20.  TA-HA  (Ta-Ha) 
5. The Most Merciful; on the Throne He set-
tled.  
6. To Him belongs everything in the heavens 
and the earth, and everything between them, 
and everything beneath the soil.  
7. If you speak aloud —He knows the secret, 
and the most hidden.  
8. Allah, there is no god but He, His are the 
Most Beautiful Names.  
9. Has the story of Moses reached you?  
10. When he saw a fire, he said to his family, 
“Stay; I have noticed a fire; Perhaps I can 
bring you a torch therefrom, or find some 
guidance by the fire.”  
11. Then, when he reached it, he was called, “O 
Moses.  
12. I—I am your Lord. Take off your shoes. 
You are in the sacred valley of Tuwa.  
13. I have chosen you, so listen to what is re-
vealed.  
14. I—I am Allah. There is no God but I. So 
serve Me, and p ractice the prayer for My re-
membrance.  
15. The Hour is coming —but I keep it almost 
hidden —so that each soul will be paid for 
what it endeavors.  
16. And do not let him who denies it and fol-
lows his desire turn you away from it, lest you 
fall. 
17. And what i s that in your right -hand, O Mo-
ses?”  
18. He said, “This is my staff. I lean on it, and 
herd my sheep with it, and I have other uses for it.”  
19. He said, “Throw it, O Moses.”  
20. So he threw it— thereupon it became a 
moving serpent.  
21. He said, “Take hold of it, and do not fear. 
We will restore it to its original condition.  
22. And press your hand to your side; it will 
come out white, without a blemish— another 
sign.  23. That We may show you some of Our great-
est signs.  
24. Go to Pharaoh; He has transgressed. ” 
25. He said, “My Lord, put my heart at peace 
for me.  
26. And ease my task for me.  
27. And untie the knot from my tongue.  
28. So they can understand my speech.  
29. And appoint an assistant for me, from my 
family.  
30. Aaron, my brother.  
31. Strengthen me with him.  
32. And have him share in my mission.  
33. That we may glorify You much.  
34. And remember You much.  
35. You are always watching over us.”  
36. He said, “You are granted your request, O 
Moses.  
37. We had favored you another time.  
38. When We inspired your mother with the 
inspiration.  
39. `Put him in the chest; then cast him into 
the river. The river will wash him to shore, where an enemy of Mine and an enemy of his 
will pick him up. And I have bestowed upon 
you love from Me, so that you may be  reared 
before My eye.  
40. When your sister walked along, and said, 
‘Shall I tell you about someone who will take care of him?' So We returned you to your mother, that she may be comforted, and not 
sorrow. And you killed a person, but We 
saved you from str ess; and We tested you 
thoroughly. And you stayed years among the 
people of Median. Then you came back, as 
ordained, O Moses.  
41. And I made you for Myself.  
42. Go, you and your brother, with My signs, 
and do not neglect My remembrance.  
43. Go to Pharaoh. He has tyrannized.
