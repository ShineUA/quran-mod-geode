## 25.  THE CRITERION   (al-Furqan)  
then settled on the Throne. The Most Merci-
ful. Ask about Him a well -informed.  
60. And when it is said to them, “Bow down to 
the Merciful,” they say, “And what is the 
Merciful? Are we to bow down to whatever 
you command us?” And it increases their aversion.  
61. Blessed is He who placed constellations in 
the sky, and placed in it a lamp, and an illu-
minating moon.  
62. And it is He wh o made the night and the 
day alternate —for whoever desires to reflect, 
or desires to show gratitude.  
63. The servants of the Merciful are those who 
walk the earth in humility, and when the ig-
norant address them, they say, “Peace.”  
64. And those who pass th e night prostrating 
themselves to their Lord and standing up.  
65. And those who say, ‘‘Our Lord, avert from 
us the suffering of Hell, for its suffering is continuous.  
66. It is indeed a miserable residence and des-
tination.”  
67. And those who, when they spe nd, are nei-
ther wasteful nor stingy, but choose a middle 
course between that.  
68. And those who do not implore besides Al-
lah any other god, and do not kill the soul 
which Allah has made sacred —except in the 
pursuit of justice —and do not commit adul-
tery. Wh oever does that will face penalties.  
69. The punishment will be doubled for him 
on the Day of Resurrection, and he will dwell 
therein in humiliation forever.  
70. Except for those who repent, and believe, 
and do good deeds. These —Allah will replace 
their ba d deeds with good deeds. Allah is ever 
Forgiving and Merciful.  
71. Whoever repents and acts righteously —
has inclined towards Allah with repentance.  
72. And those who do not bear false witness; 
and when they come across indecencies, they pass by with dignit y. 73. And those who, when reminded of the rev-
elations of their Lord, do not fall before them 
deaf and blind.  
74. And those who say, “Our Lord, grant us de-
light in our spouses and our children, and 
make us a good example for the righteous.”  
75. Those will be awarded the Chamber for 
their patience, and will be greeted therein 
with greetings and peace.  
76. Abiding therein forever —it is an excellent 
residence and destination.  
77. Say, “What are you to my Lord without 
your prayers? You have denied the truth, and the inevitable will happen.”  
  
## 26. THE POETS  (ash-Shu’ara’ ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Ta, Seen, Meem.  
2. These are the Verses of the Clarifying Book.  
3. Perhaps you will destroy yourself with grief, 
because they do not become believers.  
4. If We will, We can send down upon them a 
sign from heaven, at which their necks will 
stay bent in humility.  
5. No fresh reminder comes to them from the 
Most Merciful, but they turn their backs at it.  
6. They have denied the truth, but soon will 
come to them the news of what they ridi-culed.  
7. Have they not seen the earth, and how 
many beautiful pairs We produced therein?  
8. Surely in this is a sign, but most of them are 
not believers.  
9. Most surely, your Lord is the Almighty, the 
Merciful.  
10. Your Lord called to Moses, “Go to the ty-
rannical people.  
11. The people of Pharaoh. Will they not fear?”
