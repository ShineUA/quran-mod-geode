## 37.  THE ALIGNERS   (as-Saffat)  
177. When it descends into their yard, misera-
ble will be the morning of those forewarned.  
178. So avoid them for a while.  
179. And watch —they will soon see.  
180. Exalted be your Lord, the Lord of Glory, 
beyond their allegations.  
181. And peace be upon the messengers.  
182. And praise be to Allah, the Lor d of the 
Worlds.  
  
## 38. SAAD (Saad ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Saad. By the renowned Quran.  
2. Those who disbelieve are steeped in arro-
gance and defiance.  
3. How many generations have We destroyed 
before them? They cried out when it was too 
late to escape.  
4. And they marveled that a warner has come 
to them from among them. The disbelievers 
said, “This is a lying magician.”  
5. “Did he turn all the gods into one God? This 
is something strange.”  
6. The notables among them announced: “G o 
on, and hold fast to your gods. This is some-thing planned.  
7. We never heard of this in the former faith. 
This is nothing but a fabrication.  
8. Was the message sent down to him, out of 
all of us?” In fact, they are doubtful of My 
warning. In fact, they h ave not yet tasted My 
punishment.  
9. Or do they possess the treasuries of the 
mercy of your Lord —the Majestic, the Giver?  
10. Or do they possess the sovereignty of the 
heavens and the earth and what is between 
them? Then let them ascend the ropes.  
11. An army of confederates will be defeated 
there.  12. Before them the people of Noah denied the 
truth; as did Aad, and Pharaoh of the Stakes.  
13. And Thamood, and the people of Lot, and 
the dwellers of the Woods —these were the 
confederates.  
14. None of them but denied the messengers, 
so My retribution was deserved.  
15. These can expect only a single scream, 
from which there is no recovery.  
16. And they say, “Our Lord, hasten Your writ 
upon us, before the Day of Account.”  
17. Be patient in the face of what they say, and 
mention Our servant David, the resourceful. He was obedient.  
18. We committed the mountains to glorify 
with him, in the evening and at daybreak.  
19. And the birds, gathered together. All obe-
dient to him.  
20. And We strengthened his kingdom, and 
gave him wisdom and decisive speech.  
21. Has the story of the two disputants reached 
you? When they scaled the sanctuary?  
22. When they entered upon David, and he 
was startled by them. They said, “Do not fear. 
Two disputants; one of us has wronged the 
other ; so judge between us fairly, and do not 
be biased, and guide us to the straight way.”  
23. “This brother of mine has ninety nine 
ewes, and I have one ewe, and he said, ‘En-trust it to me,’ and he pressured me with 
words.”  
24. He said, “He has done you wrong  by asking 
your ewe in addition to his ewes. Many part-
ners take advantage of one another, except those who believe and do good deeds, but 
these are so few.” David realized that We 
were testing him, so he sought forgiveness 
from his Lord, and fell down to his knees, and 
repented.  
25. So We forgave him that. And for him is 
nearness to Us, and a good place of return.  
26. “O David, We made you a ruler in the land, 
so judge between the people with justice, and 
do not follow desire, lest it diverts you from
