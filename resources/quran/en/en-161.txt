## 33.  THE CONFEDERATES   (al-Ahzab)    
70. O you who believe! Be conscious of Allah, 
and speak in a straightforward manner.  
71. He will rectify your conduct for you, and 
will forgi ve you your sins. Whoever obeys Al-
lah and His Messenger has won a great vic-
tory.  
72. We offered the Trust to the heavens, and 
the earth, and the mountains; but they re-
fused to bear it, and were apprehensive of it; but the human being accepted it. He was un-
fair and ignorant.  
73. Allah will punish the hypocrites, men and 
women, and the idolaters, men and women. And Allah will redeem the believers, men and 
women. Allah is Ever -Forgiving, Most Mer-
ciful.  
  
## 34. SHEBA  (Saba’ ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, th e Merciful  
1. Praise be to Allah, to Whom belongs every-
thing in the heavens and the earth; and praise 
be to Him in the Hereafter. He is the Wise, 
the Expert.  
2. He knows what penetrates into the earth, 
and what comes out of it, and what descends 
from the s ky, and what ascends to it. He is the 
Merciful, the Forgiving.  
3. Those who disbelieve say, “The Hour will 
not come upon us.” Say, “Yes indeed, by my Lord, it will come upon you. He is the 
Knower of the unseen.” Not an atom's weight 
in the heavens and the earth, or anything 
smaller or larger, escapes His knowledge. All are in a Clear Record.  
4. That He may recompense those who believe 
and do good works. Those will have for-
giveness, and a generous provision.  
5. As for those who strive against Our revela-
tions , seeking to undermine them —for them 
is a punishment of a painful plague.  
6. Those who received knowledge know that 
what is revealed to you from your Lord is the truth; and it guides to the path of the Majes-tic, the Praiseworthy.  
7. Those who disbelieved s aid, “Shall we point 
out to you a man, who will tell you that, once 
torn into shreds, you will be in a new crea-
tion?  
8. Did he invent a lie about Allah, or is there 
madness in him?” Indeed, those who do not 
believe in the Hereafter are in torment, and 
far astray.  
9. Do they not reflect upon what lies before 
them and behind them, of the heaven and the 
earth? If We will, We can make the earth cave in beneath them, or make pieces of the sky 
fall down on them. In that is a sign for every 
devout servant.  
10. We bestowed upon David favor from Us: 
“O mountains, and birds: echo with him.” 
And We softened iron for him.  
11. “Make coats of armor, and measure the 
links well; and work righteousness. I am Ob-
servant of everything you do.”  
12. And for Solomon the wind —its o utward 
journey was one month, and its return jour-
ney was one month. And We made a spring of tar flow for him. And there were sprites 
that worked under him, by the leave of his 
Lord. But whoever of them swerved from Our command, We make him taste of the 
punishment of the Inferno.  
13. They made for him whatever he wished: 
sanctuaries, statues, bowls like pools, and heavy cauldrons. “O House of David, work 
with appreciation,” but a few of My servants 
are appreciative.  
14. Then, when We decreed death for him, 
nothing indicated his death to them except an 
earthworm eating at his staff. Then, when he 
fell down, it became clear to the sprites that, 
had they known the unseen, they would not 
have remained in the demeaning torment.  
15. In Sheba’s homeland there used to be a 
wonder: two gardens, on the right, and on the 
left. “Eat of your Lord’s provision, and give 
thanks to Him.” A good land, and a forgiving 
Lord.
