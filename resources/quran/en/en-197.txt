## 48. VICTORY  (al-Fath ) 
He knew what was in their hearts, and sent 
down serenity upon them, and rewarded 
them with an imminent conquest.  
19. And abundant gains for them to capture. 
Allah is Mighty and Wise.  
20. Allah has promised you abundant gains, 
which you wil l capture. He has expedited this 
for you, and has restrained people’s hands from you; that it may be a sign to the believ-
ers, and that He may guide you on a straight 
path.  
21. And other things, of which you were inca-
pable, but Allah has encompassed them. A l-
lah is Capable of everything.  
22. If those who disbelieve had fought you, 
they would have turned back and fled, then 
found neither protector nor helper.  
23. It is Allah’s pattern, ongoing since the past. 
You will never find any change in Allah’s pat-
tern.  
24. It is He who withheld their hands from 
you, and your hands from them, in the valley of Mecca, after giving you advantage over 
them. Allah is Observer of what you do.  
25. It is they who disbelieved, and barred you 
from the Sacred Mosque, and prevented t he 
offering from reaching its destination. Were 
it not for faithful men and faithful women, 
whom you did not know, you were about to 
hurt them, and became guilty of an uninten-
tional crime. Thus Allah admits into His 
mercy whomever He wills. Had they dis-
persed, We would have punished those who 
disbelieved among them with a painful pen-
alty. 
26. Those who disbelieved filled their hearts 
with rage —the rage of the days of ignorance. 
But Allah sent His serenity down upon His 
Messenger, and upon the believers, and  im-
posed on them the words of righteousness —
of which they were most worthy and deserv-
ing. Allah is aware of everything.  
27. Allah has fulfilled His Messenger’s vision 
in truth: “You will enter the Sacred Mosque, 
Allah willing, in security, heads shaven, or  
hair cut short, not fearing. He knew what you did not know, and has granted besides that an 
imminent victory.”  
28. It is He who sent His Messenger with the 
guidance and the religion of truth, to make it 
prevail over all religions. Allah suffices as 
Witnes s. 
29. Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. 
Those with him are stern against the disbe-
lievers, yet compassionate amongst them-selves. You see them kneeling, prostrating, 
seeking blessings from Allah and approval. 
Their marks are on their faces from the ef-
fects of p rostration. Such is their description 
in the Torah, and their description in the 
Gospel: like a plant that sprouts, becomes 
strong, grows thick, and rests on its stem, im-
pressing the farmers. Through them He en-
rages the disbelievers. Allah has promised those among them who believe and do good 
deeds forgiveness and a great reward.  
  
## 49. THE CHAMBERS  (al-Hujurat)  
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. O you who believe! Do not place your opin-
ions above that of Allah and His Messenger, 
and fear Al lah. Allah is Hearing and Know-
ing. 
2. O you who believe! Do not raise your voices 
above the voice of the Prophet, and do not 
speak loudly to him, as you speak loudly to one another, lest your works be in vain with-
out you realizing.  
3. Those who lower their  voices before Allah’s 
Messenger —those are they whose hearts Al-
lah has tested for piety. They will have for-
giveness and a great reward.  
4. Those who call you from behind the cham-
bers—most of them do not understand.  
5. Had they remained patient until you ca me 
out to them, it would have been better for 
them. But Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
