## 16.  THE BEE   (an-Nahl)  
73. So the Blas t struck them at sunrise.  
74. And We turned it upside down, and rained 
down upon them stones of baked clay.  
75. Surely in that are lessons for those who 
read signs.  
76. And it is on an existing road.  
77. Surely in that is a sign for the believers.  
78. The people of the Woods were also wrong-
doers.  
79. So We took revenge upon them. Both are 
clearly documented.  
80. The people of the Rock also rejected the 
messengers.  
81. We gave them Our revelations, but they 
turned away from them.  
82. They used to carve homes  in the moun-
tains, feeling secure.  
83. But the Blast struck them in the morning.  
84. All they had acquired was of no avail to 
them.  
85. We did not create the heavens and the 
earth, and what lies between them, except 
with truth. The Hour is coming, so forg ive 
with gracious forgiveness.  
86. Your Lord is the All -Knowing Creator.  
87. We have given you seven of the pairs, and 
the Grand Quran.  
88. Do not extend your eyes towards what We 
have bestowed on some couples of them to 
enjoy, and do not grieve over them,  and lower 
your wing to the believers.  
89. And say, “I am the clear warner.”  
90. Just as We sent down to the separatists.  
91. Those who made the Quran obsolete.  
92. By your Lord, we will question them all.  
93. About what they used to do.  
94. So proclaim op enly what you are com-
manded, and turn away from the polytheists.  
95. We are enough for you against the mock-
ers. 96. Those who set up another god with Allah. 
They will come to know.  
97. We are aware that your heart is strained by 
what they say.  
98. So glori fy the praise of your Lord, and be 
among those who bow down.  
99. And worship your Lord in order to attain 
certainty.  
  
16. THE BEE  
(an-Nahl ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. The command of Allah has come, so do not 
rush it. Glory be to H im; exalted above what 
they associate.  
2. He sends down the angels with the Spirit by 
His command, upon whom He wills of His 
servants: “Give warning that there is no god 
but Me, and fear Me.”  
3. He created the heavens and the earth with 
justice. He is exalted above the associations 
they attribute.  
4. He created the human being from a drop of 
fluid, yet he becomes an open adversary.  
5. And the livestock —He created them for 
you. In them are warmth and benefits for you, and of them you eat.  
6. And there is  beauty in them for you, when 
you bring them home, and when you drive 
them to pasture.  
7. And they carry your loads to territory you 
could not have reached without great hard-
ship. Your Lord is Clement and Merciful.  
8. And the horses, and the mules, and the  don-
keys —for you to ride, and for luxury. And He 
creates what you do not know.  
9. It is for Allah to point out the paths, but 
some of them are flawed. Had He willed, He 
could have guided you all.
