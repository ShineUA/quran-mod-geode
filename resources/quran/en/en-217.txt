## 64. GATHERING  (at-Taghabun )  
17. If you lend Allah a good  loan, He will mul-
tiply it for you, and will forgive you. Allah is 
Appreciative and Forbearing.  
18. The Knower of the Unseen and the Seen, 
the Almighty, the Wise.  
  
## 65. DIVORCE  (at-Talaq ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. O Prophet! If any of you divorce women, di-
vorce them during their period of purity, and 
calculate their term. And be pious before Al-
lah, your Lord. And do not evict them from 
their homes, nor shall they leave, unless they 
have committed a proven adultery. These are 
the limits of Allah —whoever oversteps Al-
lah’s limits has wronged his own soul. You 
never know; Allah may afterwards bring 
about a new situation.  
2. Once they have reached their term, either 
retain them honorably, or separate from them honorably. And call to wi tness two just 
people from among you, and give upright tes-timony for Allah. By that is exhorted whoever 
believes in Allah and the Last Day. And who-
ever fears Allah —He will make a way out for 
him.  
3. And will provide for him from where he 
never expected. Wh oever relies on Allah —
He will suffice him. Allah will accomplish His 
purpose. Allah has set a measure to all things.  
4. As for those of your women who have 
reached menopause, if you have any doubts, 
their term shall be three months —and also 
for those who have not menstruated. As for 
those who are pregnant, their term shall be 
until they have delivered. Whoever fears Al-
lah—He will make things easy for him.  
5. This is the ordinance of Allah, which He 
sent down to you. Whoever fears Allah— He 
will remit his sin s, and will amplify his re-
ward.  
6. Allow them to reside where you reside, ac-
cording to your means, and do not harass them in order to make things difficult for 
them. If they are pregnant, spend on them 
until they give birth. And if they nurse your 
infant, give them their payment. And con-
duct your relation in amity. But if you disa-gree, then let another woman nurse him.  
7. The wealthy shall spend according to his 
means; and he whose resources are restricted 
shall spend according to what Allah has given 
him. Allah never burdens a soul beyond what 
He has given it. Allah will bring ease after 
hardship.  
8. How many a town defied the command of 
its Lord and His messengers? So We held it 
strictly accountable, and We punished it with 
a dreadful punishment.  
9. It tas ted the result of its decisions, and the 
outcome of its decisions was perdition.  
10. Allah has prepared for them a severe retri-
bution. So beware of Allah, O you who pos-
sess intellect and have faith. Allah has sent 
down to you a Reminder.  
11. A messenger who recites to you Allah’s 
Verses, clear and distinct, that he may bring 
those who believe and work righteousness 
from darkness into light. Whoever believes in 
Allah and acts with integrity, He will admit 
him into gardens beneath which rivers flow, 
therein  to abide forever. Allah has given him 
an excellent provision.  
12. Allah is He Who created seven heavens, 
and their like of earth. The command de-
scends through them, so that you may know 
that Allah is Capable of everything, and that 
Allah Encompasses every thing in knowledge.  
  
## 66. PROHIBITION  (at-Tahrim ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. O prophet! Why do you prohibit what Allah 
has permitted for you, seeking to please your 
wives? Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
