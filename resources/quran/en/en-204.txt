## 53.  THE STAR   (an-Najm) 
59. Do you marvel at this discourse ? 
60. And laugh, and do not weep?  
61. Lost in your frivolity?  
62. So bow down to Allah, and worship!  
  
## 54. THE MOON  (al-Qamar ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. The Hour has drawn near, and the moon 
has split.  
2. Yet whenever they see a miracle, they turn 
away, and say, “Continuous magic.”  
3. They lied, and followed their opinions, but 
everything has its time.  
4. And there came to them news containing a 
deterrent.  
5. Profound wisdom —but warnings are of no 
avail.  
6. So turn away from them.  On the Day when 
the Caller calls to something terrible.  
7. Their eyes humiliated, they will emerge 
from the graves, as if they were swarming lo-
custs.  
8. Scrambling towards the Caller, the disbe-
lievers will say, “This is a difficult Day.”  
9. Before them the people of Noah disbelieved. 
They rejected Our servant, and said, “Crazy,” and he was rebuked.  
10. So he appealed to his Lord, “I am over-
whelmed, so help me.”  
11. So We opened the floodgates of heaven 
with water pouring down.  
12. And We made the earth bur st with springs, 
and the waters met for a purpose already des-
tined.  
13. And We carried him on a craft of planks 
and nails.  
14. Sailing before Our eyes; a reward for him 
who was rejected.  15. And We left it as a sign. Is there anyone 
who would take heed?  
16. So how were My punishment and My 
warnings?  
17. We made the Quran easy to learn. Is there 
anyone who would learn?  
18. Aad denied the truth. So how were My 
punishment and My warnings? 
19. We unleashed upon them a screaming 
wind, on a day of unrelenting mis ery. 
20. Plucking the people away, as though they 
were trunks of uprooted palm -trees.  
21. So how were My punishment and My 
warnings?  
22. We made the Quran easy to remember. Is 
there anyone who would remember?  
23. Thamood rejected the warnings.  
24. They said, “Are we to follow one of us, a 
human being? We would then go astray, and 
end up in Hell.  
25. Was the message given to him, out of all of 
us? In fact, he is a wicked liar.”  
26. They will know tomorrow who the wicked 
liar is.  
27. We are sending the she -camel as a test for 
them; so watch them and be patient.  
28. And inform them that the water is to be 
shared between them; each share of drink 
made available.  
29. But they called their friend, and he dared, 
and he slaughtered.  
30. So how were My punishment and My 
warnings?  
31. We sent against them a single Scream, and 
they became like crushed hay.  
32. We made the Quran easy to understand. Is 
there anyone who would understand?  
33. The people of Lot rejected the warnings.  
34. We unleashed upon them a shower of  
stones, except for the family of Lot; We res-cued them at dawn.
