## 67. SOVEREIGNTY  (al-Mulk ) 
9. They will say, “Yes, a warner did come to us, 
but we disbelieved, and said, ‘Allah did not 
send down anything; you are very much mis-
taken.’”  
10. And they will say, “Had we listened or rea-
soned, we would not have been among the in-
mates of the Blaze.”  
11. So they will acknowledge their sins. So 
away with the inmates of the Blaze.  
12. As for those who fear their Lord in secret—
for them is forgiveness and a great reward.  
13. Whether you keep your words secret, or 
declare them —He is Aware of the inner  
thoughts.  
14. Would He not know, He Who created? He 
is the Refined, the Expert.  
15. It is He who made the earth manageable for 
you, so travel its regions, and eat of His pro-
visions. To Him is the Resurgence.  
16. Are you confident that the One in heaven 
will not cause the earth to collapse beneath 
you as it spins?  
17. Or are you confident that the One in 
Heaven will not unleash against you a violent 
storm? Then you will know what My warning 
is like.  
18. Those before them also denied the truth; 
and how was M y disapproval?  
19. Have they not seen the birds above them, 
spreading their wings, and folding them? 
None holds them except the Compassionate. 
He is Perceiver of everything.  
20. Or who is this who is a force for you to pro-
tect you against the Compassionate ? The dis-
believers are in nothing but delusion.  
21. Or who is this that will provide for you, if 
He withholds His provision? Yet they persist 
in defiance and aversion.  
22. Is he who walks bent on his own design 
better guided, or he who walks upright on a 
straight path?  
23. Say, “It is He who produced you; and made 
for you the hearing, and the vision, and the 
organs. But rarely do you give thanks.”  24. Say, “It is He who scattered you on earth, 
and to Him you will be rounded up.”  
25. And they say, “When will  this promise be 
fulfilled, if you are truthful?”  
26. Say, “Knowledge is with Allah, and I am 
only a clear warner.”  
27. But when they see it approaching, the faces 
of those who disbelieved will turn gloomy, 
and it will be said, “This is what you used to 
call for.”  
28. Say, “Have you considered? Should Allah 
make me perish, and those with me; or else 
He bestows His mercy on us; who will protect 
the disbelievers from an agonizing torment?”  
29. Say, “He is the Compassionate. We have 
faith in Him, and in Him we  trust. Soon you 
will know who is in evident error.”  
30. Say, “Have you considered? If your water 
drains away, who will bring you pure running water?”  
  
## 68. THE PEN  (al-Qalam ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Noon. By the pen, and by what they in-
scribe.  
2. By the grace of your Lord, you are not in-
sane.  
3. In fact, you will have a reward that will 
never end.  
4. And you are of a great moral character.  
5. You will see, and they will see.  
6. Which of you is the afflicted.  
7. Your Lord know s best who has strayed from 
His path, and He knows best the well -guided.  
8. So do not obey the deniers.  
9. They would like you to compromise, so they 
would compromise.  
10. And do not obey any vile swearer.  
11. Backbiter, spreader of slander.
