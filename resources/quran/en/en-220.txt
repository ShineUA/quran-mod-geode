## 68.  THE PEN   (al-Qalam)  
12. Preventer of good, transgressor, sinner.  
13. Rude and fake besides.  
14. Just because he has money and children.  
15. When Our Verses are recited to him, he 
says, “Myths of the ancients!”  
16. We will brand him on the muzzle.  
17. We tested them, as We tested the owners  of 
the garden, when they vowed to harvest it in 
the morning.  
18. Without any reservation.  
19. But a calamity from your Lord went 
around it while they slept.  
20. And in the morning it was as if picked.  
21. In the morning, they called to one another.  
22. “Go early to your plantation, if you are go-
ing to harvest.”  
23. So off they went, murmuring to one an-
other.  
24. “No poor person is to enter it upon you to-
day.”  
25. And early they went, resolved in intent.  
26. But when they saw it, they said, “We were 
wrong.  
27. We are now deprived.”  
28. The most reasonable of them said, “Did I 
not say to you, ‘if only you would glorify?’”  
29. They said, “Glory to our Lord —We were 
indeed in the wrong.”  
30. Then they turned to one another, blaming 
one another.  
31. They said, “W oe to us —we were indeed 
domineering.  
32. Perhaps our Lord will give us a better sub-
stitute for it. We are turning to our Lord.”  
33. Such is the punishment; but the punish-
ment of the Hereafter is greater, if they only knew.  
34. For the righteous are Gardens  of Delight 
with their Lord.  
35. Shall We treat the Muslims like the vil-
lains?  36. What is the matter with you? How do you 
judge?  
37. Or do you have a scripture in which you 
study.  
38. Wherein there is whatever you choose?  
39. Or do you have oaths from Us,  binding un-
til the Day of Resurrection, that you will have whatever you demand?  
40. Ask them, which of them will guarantee 
that.  
41. Or do they have partners? Then let them 
produce their partners, if they are truthful.  
42. On the Day when the Shin will be exposed, 
and they will be called to bow down, but they 
will be unable.  
43. Their eyes subdued, shame will cover 
them. They were invited to bow down when 
they were sound.  
44. So leave Me to those who reject this dis-
course; We will proceed against them gradu-ally, from where they do not know.  
45. And I will give them respite. My plan is 
firm.  
46. Or do you ask them for a fee, so they are 
burdened with debt?  
47. Or do they know the future, and so they 
write it down?  
48. So wait patiently for the Decision of you r 
Lord, and do not be like the Fellow of the Fish 
who cried out in despair.  
49. Were it not for his Lord’s favor that 
reached him, he would have been thrown 
into the wilderness, fully despised.  
50. But his Lord chose him, and made him one 
of the righteous.  
51. Those who disbelieve almost stab you with 
their glances when they hear the message, and say, “He is crazy!”  
52. But it is no less than a reminder to all the 
Worlds.
