## 80. HE FROWNED  (â€˜Abasa )  
4. Or be reminded, and the message would 
benefit him.  
5. But as for him who was indifferent.  
6. You gave him your attention.  
7. Though you are not liabl e if he does not pu-
rify himself.  
8. But as for him who came to you seeking.  
9. In awe.  
10. To him you were inattentive.  
11. Do not. This is a Lesson.  
12. Whoever wills, shall remember it.  
13. On honorable pages.  
14. Exalted and purified.  
15. By the hands o f scribes.  
16. Noble and devoted.  
17. Perish man! How thankless he is!  
18. From what did He create him?  
19. From a sperm drop He created him, and 
enabled him.  
20. Then He eased the way for him.  
21. Then He puts him to death, and buries 
him.  
22. Then, when He wills, He will resurrect 
him.  
23. But no, he did not fulfill what He has com-
manded him.  
24. Let man consider his food.  
25. We pour down water in abundance.  
26. Then crack the soil open.  
27. And grow in it grains.  
28. And grapes and herbs.  
29. And olives and dates.  
30. And luscious gardens.  
31. And fruits and vegetables.  
32. Enjoyment for you, and for your livestock.  
33. But when the Deafening Noise comes to 
pass.  34. The Day when a person will flee from his 
brother.  
35. And his mother and his fathe r. 
36. And his consort and his children.  
37. Every one of them, on that Day, will have 
enough to preoccupy him.  
38. Faces on that Day will be radiant.  
39. Laughing and rejoicing.  
40. And Faces on that Day will be covered with 
misery.  
41. Overwhelmed by rem orse.  
42. These are the faithless, the vicious.  
  
## 81. THE ROLLING  (at-Takwir ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. When the sun is rolled up.  
2. When the stars are dimmed.  
3. When the mountains are set in motion.  
4. When the relationships ar e suspended.  
5. When the beasts are gathered.  
6. When the oceans are set aflame.  
7. When the souls are paired.  
8. When the girl, buried alive, is asked:  
9. For what crime was she killed?  
10. When the records are made public.  
11. When the sky is peeled away.  
12. When the Fire is set ablaze.  
13. When Paradise is brought near.  
14. Each soul will know what it has readied.  
15. I swear by the galaxies.  
16. Precisely running their courses.  
17. And by the night as it recedes.  
18. And by the morn as it breathes.  
19. This is the speech of a noble messenger.
