## 26.  THE POETS   (ash-Shu’ara’)  
149. And you skillfully carve houses in the 
mountains?  
150. So fear Allah, and obey me.  
151. And do not obey the command of the ex-
travagant.  
152. Who spread turmoil on earth, and do not 
reform.”  
153. They said, “You are surely one of the be-
witched.  
154. You are nothing but a man like us. So 
bring us a sign, if you are truthful.  
155. He said, “This is a she -camel; she has her 
turn of d rinking, and you have your turn of 
drinking —on a specified day.  
156. And do not touch her with harm, lest the 
punishment of a great day seizes you.”  
157. But they slaughtered her, and became full 
of remorse.  
158. So the punishment overtook them. Surely 
in this is a sign, but most of them are not be-
lievers.  
159. Your Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.  
160. The people of Lot disbelieved the messen-
gers.  
161. When their brother Lot said to them, “Do 
you not fear?  
162. I am to you a faithful messenger.  
163. So fear Allah, and obey me.  
164. I ask of you no payment for it. My pay-
ment is only from the Lord of the Worlds.  
165. Do you approach the males of the world?  
166. And forsake the wives your Lord created 
for you? Indeed, you are intrusive people.”  
167. They sa id, “Unless you refrain, O Lot, you 
will be expelled.”  
168. He said, “I certainly deplore your con-
duct.”  
169. “My Lord, save me and my family from 
what they do.”  
170. So We saved him and his family, alto-
gether.  171. Except for an old woman among those 
who tarried.  
172. Then We destroyed the others.  
173. And We rained down on them a rain. 
Dreadful is the rain of those forewarned.  
174. Surely in this is a sign, but most of them 
are not believers.  
175. Your Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.  
176. The People of the Woods disbelieved the 
messengers.  
177. When Shuaib said to them, “Do you not 
fear?  
178. I am to you a trustworthy messenger.  
179. So fear Allah, and obey me.  
180. I ask of you no payment for it. My pay-
ment is only from the Lord of the Worlds.  
181. Give full measure, and do not cheat.  
182. And weigh with accurate scales.  
183. And do not defraud people of their be-
longings, and do not work corruption in the 
land.  
184. And fear Him who created you and the 
masses of old.”  
185. They said, “You are one of t hose be-
witched.  
186. And you are nothing but a man like us; 
and we think that you are a liar.  
187. So bring down on us pieces from the sky, 
if you are truthful.”  
188. He said, “My Lord is Well Aware of what 
you do.”  
189. But they denied him. So the punishm ent 
of the day of gloom gripped them. It was the 
punishment of a great day.  
190. Surely in this is a sign, but most of them 
are not believers.  
191. Your Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.  
192. It is a revelation from the Lord of the 
Worlds.  
193. The Hones t Spirit came down with it.
