## 7.  THE ELEVATIONS   (al-A’raf)  
recite His praises, and to Him they bow 
down.  
  
## 8. THE SPOILS  (al-Anfal ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. They ask you about the bounties. Say, “The 
bounties are for Allah and the Messenger.” So 
be mindful of Allah, and settle your differ-
ences, and obey Allah and His Messenger, if 
you are believers.  
2. The believers are those whose hearts trem-
ble when Allah is  mentioned, and when His 
revelations are recited to them, they 
strengthen them in faith, and upon their Lord 
they rely.  
3. Those who perform the prayer; and from 
Our provisions to them, they spend.  
4. These are the true believers. They have high 
standing with their Lord, and forgiveness, 
and a generous provision.  
5. Even as your Lord brought you out of your 
home with the truth, some believers were re-
luctant.  
6. Arguing with you about the truth after it 
was made clear, as if they were being driven to death as they looked on.  
7. Allah has promised you one of the two 
groups —that it would be yours —but you 
wanted the unarmed group to be yours. Allah 
intends to prove the truth with His words, 
and to uproot the disbelievers.  
8. In order to confirm the truth and nu llify 
falsehood, even though the guilty dislike it.  
9. When you appealed to your Lord for help, 
He answered you, “I am reinforcing you with one thousand angels in succession.”  
10. Allah only made it a message of hope, and 
to set your hearts at rest. Victor y comes only 
from Allah. Allah is Mighty and Wise.  
11. He made drowsiness overcome you, as a se-
curity from Him. And He sent down upon you water from the sky, to cleanse you with 
it, and to rid you of Satan’s pollution, and to 
fortify your hearts, and to st rengthen your 
foothold.  
12. Your Lord inspired the angels: “I am with 
you, so support those who believe. I will cast 
terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. 
So strike above the necks, and strike off every 
fingertip of theirs.”  
13. That is because t hey opposed Allah and His 
Messenger. Whoever opposes Allah and His 
Messenger —Allah is severe in retribution.  
14. “Here it is; so taste it.” For the disbelievers 
there is the suffering of the Fire.  
15. O you who believe! When you meet those 
who disbelieve o n the march, never turn your 
backs on them.  
16. Anyone who turns his back on them on 
that Day, except while maneuvering for bat-
tle, or to join another group, has incurred 
wrath from Allah, and his abode is Hell —
what a miserable destination!  
17. It was not you who killed them, but it was 
Allah who killed them. And it was not you who launched when you launched, but it was Allah who launched. That He may bestow 
upon the believers an excellent reward. Allah 
is Hearing and Knowing.  
18. Such is the case. Allah w ill undermine the 
strategy of the disbelievers.  
19. If you desire a verdict, the verdict has come 
to you. And if you desist, it would be best for 
you. And if you return, We will return; and your troops, however numerous, will not 
benefit you. Allah is with the believers.  
20. O you who believe! Obey Allah and His 
Messenger, and do not turn away from him 
when you hear.  
21. And be not like those who say, “We hear,” 
when they do not hear.  
22. The worst of animals to Allah are the deaf 
and dumb —those who do not reason.  
23. Had Allah recognized any good in them, 
He would have made them hear; and had He
