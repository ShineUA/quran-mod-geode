## 37.  THE ALIGNERS   (as-Saffat)  
76. And We saved him and his family from the 
great calamity.  
77. And We made his descendants the survi-
vors.  
78. And We left mention of him among those 
who succeeded.  
79. Peace be upon Noah among all people.  
80. We thus reward the righteous.  
81. He was one of Our believing servants.  
82. Then We drowned the others.  
83. Of his kind was Abraham.  
84. When he came to his Lord with a sound 
heart . 
85. He said to his father and his people, “What 
are you worshiping?  
86. Is it falsified gods, instead of Allah, that you 
want?  
87. So what is your opinion about the Lord of 
the Worlds?”  
88. Then he took a glance at the stars.  
89. And said, “I am sick.”  
90. But they turned their backs on him, and 
went away.  
91. Then he turned to their gods, and said, 
“will you not eat?  
92. What is it with you, that you do not speak?”  
93. Then he turned on them, striking with his 
right hand.  
94. And they came running towards him.  
95. He said, “Do you worship what you carve?  
96. When Allah created you, and what you 
manufacture?”  
97. They said, “Build a pyre for him, and throw 
him into the furnace.”  
98. They wished him ill, but We made them 
the losers.  
99.  He said, “I am g oing towards my Lord, and 
He will guide me.”  
100. “My Lord, give me one of the righteous.”  101. So We gave him good news of a clement 
boy.  
102. Then, when he was old enough to accom-
pany him, he said, “O My son, I see in a 
dream that I am sacrificing you; s ee what you 
think.” He said, “O my Father, do as you are 
commanded; you will find me, Allah willing, 
one of the steadfast.”  
103. Then, when they had submitted, and he 
put his forehead down.  
104. We called out to him, “O Abraham!  
105. You have fulfilled the vision.” Thus We re-
ward the doers of good.  
106. This was certainly an evident test.  
107. And We redeemed him with a great sacri-
fice. 
108. And We left with him for later genera-
tions.  
109. Peace be upon Abraham.  
110. Thus We reward the doers of good.  
111. He was one of Our believing servants.  
112. And We gave him good news of Isaac, a 
prophet, one of the righteous.  
113. And We blessed him, and Isaac. But 
among their descendants are some who are 
righteous, and some who are clearly unjust to 
themselves.  
114. And We blessed Moses and Aaron.  
115. And We delivered them and their people 
from the terrible disaster.  
116. And We supported them, and so they were 
the victors.  
117. And We gave them the Clarifying Scrip-
ture.  
118. And We guided them upon the straight 
path.  
119. And We left with them for later genera-
tions.  
120. Peace be upon Moses and Aaron.  
121. Thus We reward the righteous.  
122. They were of Our believing servants.
