## 37.  THE ALIGNERS   (as-Saffat)  
71. Have they not seen that We created for 
them, of Our Handiwork, livestock that they 
own?  
72. And We subdued them for them. Some 
they ride, and some they eat.  
73. And they have in them other benefits, and 
drinks. Will they not give thanks?  
74. Yet they have taken to themselves gods 
other than Allah, that perhaps they may be 
helped.  
75. They cannot help them, although they are 
arrayed as troops for them.  
76. So let their words not sadden you. We 
know what they conceal, and what they re-veal.  
77. Does the human being not consider that 
We created him from a seed? Yet he becomes 
a fierce adversary.  
78. And he produces arguments against Us, 
and he forgets his own creation. He says, “Who will revive the bones when they have 
decayed?”  
79. Say, “He who initiated them in the first in-
stance will revive them. He has knowledge of 
every creation.”  
80. He who produced fuel for you from the 
green trees, with which you kindle a fire.  
81. Is not He who created the heavens and the 
earth able to create the like of them? Cer-
tainly. He is the Supreme All -Knowing Crea-
tor. 
82. His command, when He wills a thing, is to 
say to it, “Be,” and it comes to be.  
83. So glory be to Him in whose hand is the 
dominion of everything, and to Him you will be returned.  
  
37. THE ALIGNERS  
(as-Saffat ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. By the aligners aligning.  2. And the drivers driving.  
3. And the reciters of the Reminder.  
4. Your God is indeed One.  
5. Lord of the heavens and the earth, and eve-
rything between them; and Lord of the Easts.  
6. We have adorned the lower heaven with the 
beauty of the planets.  
7. And guarded it against every defiant devil.  
8. They cannot eavesdrop on the Supernal 
Elite, for they get bombarded from every side.  
9. Repelled —they will have a lingering tor-
ment.  
10. Except for him who snatches a fragment—
he gets pursued by a piercing projectile.  
11. Inquire of them,  “Are they more difficult to 
create, or the others We created?” We created 
them from sticky clay.  
12. But you wonder, and they ridicule.  
13. And when reminded, they pay no atten-
tion.  
14. And when they see a sign, they ridicule.  
15. And they say, “This is nothing but plain 
magic.  
16. When we have died and become dust and 
bones, shall we be resurrected?  
17. And our ancestors of old?”  
18. Say, “Yes indeed, and you will be totally 
subdued.”  
19. It will be a single nudge, and they will be 
staring.  
20. They will say, “Woe to us. This is the Day 
of Judgment.”  
21. “This is the Day of Separation which you 
used to deny.  
22. Gather those who did wrong, and their ma-
tes, and what they used to worship.  
23. Besides Allah, and lead them to the way to 
Hell.  
24. And stop them . They are to be questioned.”  
25. What is the matter with you? Why do you 
not help one another?
