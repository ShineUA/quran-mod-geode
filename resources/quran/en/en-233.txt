## 83. THE DEFRAUDERS  (al-Mutaffifin ) 
18. No indeed; the record of the righteous is in 
Elliyyeen.  
19. But how can you know what Elliyyoon is?  
20. A numerical book.  
21. Witnessed by those brought near.  
22. Indeed, the righteous will be amid bliss.  
23. On thrones, looking on.  
24. You will recognize on their faces the radi-
ance of bliss.  
25. They will be given to drink a sealed wine.  
26. Whose seal is musk —this is what compet-
itors should  compete for.  
27. Its mixture is of Tasneem.  
28. A spring from which those brought near 
drink.  
29. Those who committed crimes used to 
laugh at those who believed.  
30. And when they passed by them, they would 
wink at one another.  
31. And when they went back  to their families, 
they would go back exulting.  
32. And if they saw them, they would say, 
“These people are lost.”  
33. Yet they were not sent as guardians over 
them.  
34. But on that Day, those who believed will 
laugh at the unbelievers.  
35. On luxurious furnishings, looking on.  
36. Have the unbelievers been repaid for what 
they used to do?  
  
## 84. THE RUPTURE  (al-Inshiqaq ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. When the sky is ruptured.  
2. And hearkens to its Lord, as it must.  
3. And when the e arth is leveled out.  4. And casts out what is in it, and becomes 
empty.  
5. And hearkens to its Lord, as it must.  
6. O man! You are laboring towards your 
Lord, and you will meet Him.  
7. As for him who is given his book in his right 
hand.  
8. He will have an easy settlement.  
9. And will return to his family delighted.  
10. But as for him who is given his book behind 
his back.  
11. He will call for death.  
12. And will enter the Blaze.  
13. He used to be happy among his family.  
14. He thought he would never return.  
15. In fact, his Lord was watching him.  
16. I swear by the twilight.  
17. And by the night, and what it covers.  
18. And by the moon, as it grows full.  
19. You will mount stage by stage.  
20. What is the matter with them that they do 
not believe?  
21. And when the Quran is read to them, they 
do not bow down?  
22. In fact, those who disbelieve are in denial.  
23. But Allah knows what they hide inside.  
24. So inform them of a painful punishment.  
25. Except those who believe and do good 
deeds; they will have an undiminished re-
ward.  
  
## 85. THE CONSTELLATIONS  (al-Buruj ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. By the sky with the constellations.  
2. And by the Promised Day.  
3. And by the witness and the witnessed.
