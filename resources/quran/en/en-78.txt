## 10.  JONAH   (Yunus)  
93. And We settled the Children of Israel in a 
position of honor, and provided them with 
good things. They did not differ until 
knowledge came to them. Your Lord will 
judge betwee n them on the Day of Resurrec-
tion regarding their differences.  
94. If you are in doubt about what We revealed 
to you, ask those who read the Scripture be-fore you. The truth has come to you from 
your Lord, so do not be of those who doubt.  
95. And do not be of those who deny Allah’s 
revelations, lest you become one of the losers.  
96. Those against whom your Lord’s Word is 
justified will not believe.  
97. Even if every sign comes to them —until 
they see the painful punishment.  
98. If only there was one town that believed 
and benefited by its belief. Except for the peo-
ple of Jonah. When they believed, We re-
moved from them the suffering of disgrace in 
the worldly life, and We gave them comfort 
for a while.  
99. Had your Lord willed, everyone on earth 
would have believed. Will you compel people 
to become believers?  
100. No soul can believe except by Allah’s 
leave; and He lays disgrace upon those who 
refuse to understand.  
101. Say, “Look at what is in the heavens and 
the earth.” But signs and warnings are of no 
avail f or people who do not believe.  
102. Do they expect anything but the likes of 
the days of those who passed away before 
them? Say, “Then wait, I will be waiting with 
you.”  
103. Then We save Our messengers and those 
who believe. It is binding on Us to save the  
believers.  
104. Say, “O people, if you are in doubt about 
my religion —I do not serve those you serve 
apart from Allah. But I serve Allah, the one 
who will terminate your lives. And I was 
commanded to be of the believers.”  105. And dedicate yourself to the  true reli-
gion —a monotheist —and never be of the 
polytheists.  
106. And do not call, apart from Allah, on what 
neither benefits you nor harms you. If you 
do, you are then one of the wrongdoers.  
107. If Allah afflicts you with harm, none can 
remove it except He. And if He wants good 
for you, none can repel His grace. He makes it reach whomever He wills of His servants. 
He is the Forgiver, the Merciful.  
108. Say, “O people, the truth has come to you 
from your Lord. Whoever accepts guidance is guided for his own  soul; and whoever strays 
only strays to its detriment. I am not a guard-
ian over you.”  
109. And follow what is revealed to you, and be 
patient until Allah issues His judgment, for 
He is the Best of judges.  
  
## 11. HUD  (Hud ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious , the Merciful  
1. Alif, Lam, Ra. A Scripture whose Verses 
were perfected, then elaborated, from One 
who is Wise and Informed.  
2. That you shall worship none but Allah. “I 
am a warner to you from Him, and a bearer 
of good news.”  
3. “And ask your Lord for forgiveness, and re-
pent to Him. He will provide you with good sustenance until a stated term, and will be-
stow His grace on every possessor of virtue. 
But if you turn away, then I fear for you the 
punishment of a grievous Day.”  
4. “To Allah is your return, and He is Capable 
of all things.”  
5. They wrap their chests to hide from Him. 
But even as they cover themselves with their 
clothes, He knows what they conceal and 
what they reveal. He knows what lies within 
the hearts.
