## 1.  THE OPENING   (al-Fatihah)
1. In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Mer-
ciful.  
2. Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.  
3. The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.  
4. Master of the Day of Judgment.  
5. It is You we worship, and upon You we call 
for help.  
6. Guide us to the straight path.  
7. The path of those You have blessed, not of 
those against whom there is anger, nor of 
those who are misguided.  
 
## 2. THE HEIFER  
(al-Baqarah ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Alif, Lam, Meem.  
2. This is the Book in which there is no doubt, 
a guide for the righteous.  
3. Those who believe in the unseen, and pe r-
form the prayers, and give from what We 
have provided for them.  
4. And those who believe in what was revealed 
to you, and in what was revealed before you, 
and are certain of the Hereafter.  
5. These are upon guidance from their Lord. 
These are the successf ul. 
6. As for those who disbelieve �it is the same 
for them, whether you have warned them, or have not warned them �they do not believe.  
7. Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on 
their hearing, and over their vision is a veil. 
They will have a severe to rment.  
8. Among the people are those who say, �We 
believe in Allah and in the Last Day,� but they 
are not believers.  9. They seek to deceive Allah and those who 
believe, but they deceive none but them-
selves, though they are not aware.  
10. In their hearts i s sickness, and Allah has in-
creased their sickness. They will have a pain-
ful punishment because of their denial.  
11. And when it is said to them, �Do not make 
trouble on earth,� they say, �We are only re-
formers.�  
12. In fact, they are the troublemakers, bu t they 
are not aware.  
13. And when it is said to them, �Believe as the 
people have believed,� they say, �Shall we be-
lieve as the fools have believed?� In fact, it is 
they who are the fools, but they do not know.  
14. And when they come across those who be-
lieve, they say, �We believe�; but when they 
are alone with their devils, they say, �We are with you; we were only ridiculing.�  
15. It is Allah who ridicules them, and leaves 
them bewildered in their transgression.  
16. Those are they who have bartered error for 
guidance; but their trade does not profit them, and they are not guided.  
17. Their likeness is that of a person who kin-
dled a fire; when it illuminated all around 
him, Allah took away their light, and left 
them in darkness, unable to see.  
18. Deaf, dumb, blind. They will not return.  
19. Or like a cloudburst from the sky, in which 
is darkness, and thunder, and lightning. They 
press their fingers into their ears from the thunderbolts, in fear of death. But Allah sur-
rounds the disbelievers.  
20. The lightning almost snatches their sight 
away. Whenever it illuminates for them, they 
walk in it; but when it grows dark over them, 
they stand still. Had Allah willed, He could 
have taken away their hearing and their sight. 
Allah is capable of everything.  
21. O people! Worship your Lord who created 
you and those before you, that you may attain piety.
