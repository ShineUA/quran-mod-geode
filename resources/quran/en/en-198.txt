## 49. THE CHAMBERS  (al-Hujurat)    
6. O you who believe! If a troublemaker brings 
you any news, investigate, lest you harm peo-
ple out of ignorance, and you become regret-
ful for what you have done.  
7. And know that among you is the Messenger 
of Allah. Had he obeyed you in many things, 
you would have suffered hardship. But Allah 
has given you the love of faith, and adorned 
it in your hearts, and made disbelief, mis-
chief, and rebellion hateful to you. The se are 
the rightly guided.  
8. A Grace and Favor from Allah. Allah is 
Knowing and Wise.  
9. If two groups of believers fight each other, 
reconcile between them. But if one group ag-
gresses against the other, fight the aggressing group until it complies with Allah’s com-
mand. Once it has complied, reconcile be-
tween them with justice, and be equitable. Al-
lah loves the equitable.  
10. The believers are brothers, so reconcile be-
tween your brothers, and remain conscious of Allah, so that you may receive mercy.  
11. O you who believe! No people shall ridicule 
other people, for they may be better than 
they. Nor shall any women ridicule other 
women, for they may be better than they. Nor 
shall you slander one another, nor shall you 
insult one another with names. Evil is th e re-
turn to wickedness after having attained 
faith. Whoever does not repent —these are 
the wrongdoers.  
12. O you who believe! Avoid most suspi-
cion —some suspicion is sinful. And do not 
spy on one another, nor backbite one an-
other. Would any of you like to ea t the flesh 
of his dead brother? You would detest it. So 
remain mindful of Allah. Allah is Most Re-lenting, Most Merciful.  
13. O people! We created you from a male and 
a female, and made you races and tribes, that 
you may know one another. The best among 
you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous. 
Allah is All -Knowing, Well -Experienced.  
14. The Desert -Arabs say, “We have believed.” 
Say, “You have not believed; but say, ‘We have submitted,’ for faith has not yet entered 
into your hearts. But if you obey Allah and 
His Messenger, He will not diminish any of 
your deeds. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.”  
15. The believers are those who believe in Al-
lah and His Messenger, and then have not 
doubted, and strive for Allah’s cause with 
their wealth and their perso ns. These are the 
sincere.  
16. Say, “Are you going to teach Allah about 
your religion, when Allah knows everything in the heavens and the earth, and Allah is 
aware of all things?”  
17. They regarded it a favor to you that they 
have submitted. Say, “Do not c onsider your 
submission a favor to me; it is Allah who has 
done you a favor by guiding you to the faith, 
if you are sincere.”  
18. Allah knows the secrets of the heavens and 
the earth, and Allah is seeing of everything 
you do.  
  
## 50. QAF  (Qaf) 
In the name of  Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Qaf. By the Glorious Quran.  
2. They marveled that a warner has come to 
them from among them. The disbelievers say, 
“This is something strange.  
3. When we have died and become dust? This 
is a farfetched return.”  
4. We k now what the earth consumes of them, 
and with Us is a comprehensive book.  
5. But they denied the truth when it has come 
to them, so they are in a confused state.  
6. Have they not observed the sky above them, 
how We constructed it, and decorated it, and 
it has no cracks?  
7. And the earth, how We spread it out, and 
set on it mountains, and grew in it all kinds 
of delightful pairs?
