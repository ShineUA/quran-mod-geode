## 74. THE ENROBED  (al-Muddathir )
26. I will roast him in Saqar.  
27. But what will explain to you what Saqar is?  
28. It neither leaves, nor spares.  
29. It scorches the flesh.  
30. Over it are Nineteen.  
31. We have appointed only angels to be war-
dens of the Fire, and caused their number to 
be a stumbling block for those who disbe-
lieve; so that those given the Scripture may 
attain certainty; and those who believe may 
increase in faith; and those given the Scrip-
ture and the believers may not doubt; and 
those in whose hearts is sickness and the un-
believers may say, “What did Allah intend by 
this parable?” Thus Allah leads astray whom He wills, and guides whom He wills. None 
knows the soldiers of your Lord except He. 
This is nothing but a reminder for the mor-
tals. 
32. Nay! By the moon.  
33. And the night as it retreats.  
34. And the morning as it lights up.  
35. It is one of the greatest.  
36. A warning to the mortals.  
37. To whomever among you wishes to ad-
vance, or regress.  
38. Every soul is hostage to what it has earned.  
39. Except for those on  the Right.  
40. In Gardens, inquiring.  
41. About the guilty.  
42. “What drove you into Saqar?”  
43. They will say, “We were not of those who 
prayed.  
44. Nor did we feed the destitute.  
45. And we used to indulge with those who in-
dulge.  
46. And we used to deny  the Day of Judgment.  
47. Until the Inevitable came upon us.”  
48. But the intercession of intercessors will not 
help them.  49. Why are they turning away from the Re-
minder?  
50. As though they were panicked donkeys.  
51. Fleeing from a lion?  
52. Yet every on e of them desires to be given 
scrolls unrolled.  
53. No indeed! But they do not fear the Here-
after.  
54. Nevertheless, it is a reminder.  
55. So whoever wills, shall remember it.  
56. But they will not remember, unless Allah 
wills. He is the Source of Righteou sness, and 
the Source of Forgiveness.  
  
## 75. RESURRECTION  (al-Qiyamah ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. I swear by the Day of Resurrection.  
2. And I swear by the blaming soul.  
3. Does man think that We will not reassem-
ble his bones?  
4. Yes indeed; We are Able to reconstruct his 
fingertips.  
5. But man wants to deny what is ahead of 
him.  
6. He asks, “When is the Day of Resurrec-
tion?”  
7. When vision is dazzled.  
8. And the moon is eclipsed.  
9. And the sun and the moon are joined to-
gether.  
10. On that Day, man will say, “Where is the 
escape?”  
11. No indeed! There is no refuge.  
12. To your Lord on that Day is the settlement.  
13. On that Day man will be informed of eve-
rything he put forward, and everything he left behind.  
14. And man will be evidence against himself.
