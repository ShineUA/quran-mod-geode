with Him.” We will inform those who disbe-
lieve of what they did, and We will make 
them taste an awful punishment.  
51. When We provide comfort for the human 
being, he withdraws and distances himself; 
but when ad versity befalls him, he starts 
lengthy prayers.  
52. Say, “Have you considered? If it is from Al-
lah and you reject it —who is further astray 
than he who is cutoff and alienated?”  
53. We will show them Our proofs on the ho-
rizons, and in their very souls, unti l it be-
comes clear to them that it is the truth. Is it 
not sufficient that your Lord is witness over 
everything?  
54. Surely they are in doubt about the encoun-
ter with their Lord. Surely He comprehends 
everything.  
  
## 42. CONSULTATION  (ash-Shura ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Ha, Meem.  
2. Ayn, Seen, Qaf.  
3. Thus He inspires you, and those before 
you—Allah the Almighty, the Wise.  
4. To him belongs everything in the heavens 
and everything on earth. He is the Sublime, the Magnificent.  
5. The heavens above them almost burst apart, 
while the angels glorify the praises of their 
Lord, and ask forgiveness for those on earth. 
Allah is indeed the Forgiver, the Merciful.  
6. As for those who take masters other than 
Him: Allah is in charge of them, and  you are 
not responsible for them.  
7. Thus We inspired you with an Arabic 
Quran, that you may warn the Central City 
and whoever is around it, and to warn of the 
Day of Assembly, of which there is no doubt; 
a group in the Garden, and a group in the 
Furnace.  8. Had Allah willed, He could have made them 
one community, but He admits into His 
mercy whomever He wills. As for the wrong-
doers, they will have no protector and no sav-
ior. 
9. Or have they adopted protectors besides 
him? But Allah is the Protector, and H e gives 
life to the dead, and He has power over all 
things.  
10. Whatever matter you differ about, its judg-
ment rests with Allah. “Such is Allah, my 
Lord, in Whom I trust, and unto Him I re-
pent.”  
11. Originator of the heavens and the earth. He 
made for you mates from among yourselves, 
and pairs of animals, by means of which He multiplies you. There is nothing like Him. He 
is the Hearing, the Seeing.  
12. To Him belongs absolute control of the 
heavens and the earth. He spreads the boun-ties to whomever He wills , or reduces it. He 
is aware of all things.  
13. He prescribed for you the same religion He 
enjoined upon Noah, and what We inspired to you, and what We enjoined upon Abra-
ham, and Moses, and Jesus: “You shall up-
hold the religion, and be not divided therein. ” 
As for the idolaters, what you call them to is 
outrageous to them. Allah chooses to Himself 
whom He wills, and He guides to Himself 
whoever repents.  
14. They became divided only after knowledge 
came to them, out of resentment among 
themselves. Were it no t for a predetermined 
decision from your Lord, judgment would 
have been pronounced between them. In-
deed, those who were made to inherit the 
Book after them are in grave doubt about it.  
15. To this go on inviting, and be upright as 
you were commanded, and d o not follow 
their inclinations, and say, “I believe in what-
ever Book Allah has sent down, and I was 
commanded to judge between you equitably. 
Allah is our Lord and your Lord. We have our 
deeds, and you have your deeds. Let there be 
no quarrel between us a nd you. Allah will
