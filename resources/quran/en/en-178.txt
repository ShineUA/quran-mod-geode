have been good, so enter it, to abide therein 
eternally.”  
74. And they will say, “Praise be to Allah, who 
has fulfilled His promise to us, and made us 
inherit the land, enjoying Paradise as we 
please.” How excellent is the reward of the workers.  
75. And you will see the angels hovering 
around the Throne, glorifying their Lord 
with praise. And it will be judged between 
them equitably, and it will be said, “Praise be 
to Allah, Lord of t he Worlds.”  
  
## 40. FORGIVER  (Ghafir ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Ha, Meem.  
2. The sending down of the Scripture is from 
Allah the Almighty, the Omniscient.  
3. Forgiver of sins, Accepter of repentance, Se-
vere in punishment, Bountiful in bounty. 
There is no god but He. To Him is the ulti-
mate return.  
4. None argues against Allah’s revelations ex-
cept those who disbelieve. So do not be im-
pressed by their activities in the land.  
5. Before them the people of Noah rejected the 
truth, as did t he confederates after them. 
Every community plotted against their mes-
senger, to capture him. And they argued with 
falsehood, to defeat with it the truth. But I 
seized them. What a punishment it was!  
6. Thus the sentence of your Lord became re-
alized against  those who disbelieve, that they 
are to be inmates of the Fire.  
7. Those who carry the Throne, and those 
around it, glorify their Lord with praise, and 
believe in Him, and ask for forgiveness for 
those who believe: “Our Lord, You have en-
compassed everything in mercy and 
knowledge; so forgive those who repent and follow Your path, and protect them from the 
agony of the Blaze.  8. And admit them, Our Lord, into the Gar-
dens of Eternity, which You have promised 
them, and the righteous among their parents, 
and their spouses, and their offspring. You 
are indeed the Almighty, the Most Wise.  
9. And shield them from the evil deeds. 
Whomever You shield from the evil deeds, 
on that Day, You have had mercy on him. 
That is the supreme achievement.”  
10. Those who disbelieved will be addressed, 
“The loathing of Allah is greater than your 
loathing of yourselves —for you were invited 
to the faith, but you refused.”  
11. They will say, “Our Lord, you made us die 
twice, and twice you gave us life. Now we 
acknowledge our s ins. Is there any way out?”  
12. That is because when Allah alone was 
called upon, you disbelieved; but when others 
were associated with Him, you believed. 
Judgment rests with Allah the Sublime, the 
Majestic.  
13. It is He who shows you His wonders, and 
send s down sustenance from the sky for you. 
But none pays heed except the repentant.  
14. So call upon Allah, with sincere devotion to 
Him, even though the disbelievers resent it.  
15. Exalted in rank, Owner of the Throne. He 
conveys the Spirit, by His command, upon 
whomever He wills of His servants, to warn 
of the Day of Encounter.  
16. The Day when they will emerge, nothing 
about them will be concealed from Allah. “To 
whom does the sovereignty belong today?” 
“To Allah, the One, the Irresistible.”  
17. On that Day , every soul will be recom-
pensed for what it had earned. There will be 
no injustice on that Day. Allah is quick to set-
tle accounts.  
18. And warn them of the Day of Imminence, 
when the hearts are at the throats, choking 
them. The evildoers will have no intimate 
friend, and no intercessor to be obeyed.  
19. He knows the deceptions of the eyes, and 
what the hearts conceal.
