## 89. THE DAWN (al-Fajr)  
19. And you devour inheritance with all greed.  
20. And you love wealth with immense love.  
21. No—when the earth is leveled, pounded, 
and crushed.  
22. And your Lord comes, with the angels, row 
after row.  
23. And on that Day, Hell is brought forward. 
On that Day, man will remember, but how 
will remembrance avail him?  
24. He will say, “If only I had forwarded for my 
life.”  
25. On that Day, none will punish as He pun-
ishes.  
26. And none will shackle as He shackles.  
27. But as for you, O tranquil soul.  
28. Return to your Lord, pleased and accepted.  
29. Enter among My servants.  
30. Enter My Paradise.  
  
## 90. THE LAND  (al-Balad ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. I swear by this land.  
2. And you are a resident of this land.  
3. And by a father and what he fathered.  
4. We created man in distress.  
5. Does he think that no one has power over 
him?  
6. He says, “I have used up so much money.”  
7. Does he think that no one sees him?  
8. Did We not give him two eyes?  
9. And a tongue, and two lips?  
10. And We showed him the two ways?  
11. But he did not brave the ascent.  
12. And what will explain to you what the as-
cent is?  
13. The freeing of a slave.  14. Or the feeding on a day of hunger.  
15. An orphan near of kin.  
16. Or a destitute in the dust.  
17. Then he becomes of those who believe, and 
advise one another to patience, and advise 
one another to kindness.  
18. These are the people of happiness.  
19. But as for those who defy Our revela-
tions —these are the people of misery.  
20. Upon them is a padlocked Fire.  
  
## 91. THE SUN  (ash-Shams ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. By the sun and its radiance.  
2. And the moon as it follows it.  
3. And the day as it reveals it.  
4. And the night as it conceals it.  
5. And the sky and He who built it.  
6. And the earth and He who spread it.  
7. And the soul and He who proportioned it.  
8. And inspired it with its wickedness and its 
righteousness.  
9. Successful is he who purifies it.  
10. Failing is he who corrupts it.  
11. Thamood denied in its pride.  
12. When it followed its most wicked.  
13. The messenger of Allah said to them, “This 
is the she -camel of Allah, so let her drink.”  
14. But they called him a liar, and hamstrung 
her. So their Lord crushed them for their sin, 
and leveled it.  
15. And He does not fear its sequel.  
  
## 92. THE NIGHT  (al-Layl) 
In the name of Allah,
