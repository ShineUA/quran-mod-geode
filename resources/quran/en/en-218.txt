## 66. PROHIBITION  (at-Tahrim )  
2. Allah has decreed for y ou the dissolution of 
your oaths. Allah is your Master. He is the 
All-Knowing, the Most Wise.  
3. The Prophet told something in confidence 
to one of his wives. But when she disclosed it, 
and Allah made it known to him; he commu-
nicated part of it, and he avo ided another 
part. Then, when he informed her of it, she 
said, “Who informed you of this?” He said, 
“The All -Knowing, the All -Informed, in-
formed me.”  
4. If you repent to Allah, then your hearts have 
listened. But if you band together against him, then Alla h is his Ally, as is Gabriel, and 
the righteous believers. In addition, the an-
gels will assist him.  
5. Perhaps, if he divorces you, his Lord will 
give him in exchange wives better than you: 
submissive, believing, obedient, penitent, de-
vout, fasting —previou sly married, or virgins.  
6. O you who believe! Protect yourselves and 
your families from a Fire, whose fuel is people 
and stones. Over it are angels, fierce and pow-erful. They never disobey Allah in anything 
He commands them, and they carry out 
whatever they are commanded.  
7. O you who disbelieved! Make no excuses 
today. You are being repaid for what you 
used to do.  
8. O you who believe! Repent to Allah with 
sincere repentance. Perhaps your Lord will remit your sins, and admit you into gardens 
beneath which  rivers flow, on the Day when 
Allah will not disappoint the Prophet and 
those who believed with him. Their light 
streaming before them, and to their right, 
they will say, “Our Lord, complete our light for us, and forgive us; You are capable of all 
things.”  
9. O prophet! Strive hard against the disbe-
lievers and the hypocrites, and be stern with them. Their abode is Hell. What a miserable 
destination!  
10. Allah illustrates an example of those who 
disbelieve: the wife of Noah and the wife of 
Lot. They were und er two of Our righteous servants, but they betrayed them. They 
availed them nothing against Allah, and it 
was said, “Enter the Fire with those who are 
entering.”  
11. And Allah illustrates an example of those 
who believe: the wife of Pharaoh, when she 
said,  “My Lord, build for me, with you, a 
house in Paradise, and save me from Pharaoh 
and his works, and save me from the wrong-
doing people.”  
12. And Mary, the daughter of Imran, who 
guarded her womb, and so We breathed into 
her of Our Spirit; and she believed in the 
truth of her Lord’s Words and His Books, and 
was one of the devout.  
  
## 67. SOVEREIGNTY  (al-Mulk ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Blessed is He in whose hand is the sover-
eignty, and Who has power over everything.  
2. He who created death and life —to test 
you—as to which of you is better in conduct. 
He is the Almighty, the Forgiving.  
3. He who created seven heavens in layers. 
You see no discrepancy in the creation of the 
Compassionate. Look again. Can you see any 
cracks?  
4. Then look again, and again, and your sight 
will return to you dazzled and exhausted.  
5. We have adorned the lower heaven with 
lanterns, and made them missiles against the 
devils; and We have prepared for them the 
punishment of the Blaze.  
6. For those who reject thei r Lord, there is the 
torment of Hell. What an evil destination!  
7. When they are thrown into it, they will hear 
it roaring, as it seethes.  
8. It almost bursts with fury. Every time a 
batch is thrown into it, its keepers will ask 
them, “Has no warner come t o you?”
