## 78. THE EVENT  (an-Naba’ )  
what his hands have produced, and the faith-
less will say, “O, I wish I were  dust.”  
  
## 79. THE SNATCHERS  (an-Nazi’at ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. By those who snatch violently.  
2. And those who remove gently.  
3. And those who glide smoothly.  
4. And those who race swiftly.  
5. And those who regulate events.  
6. On the Day when the Quake quakes.  
7. And is followed by the Successor.  
8. Hearts on that Day will be pounding.  
9. Their sights downcast.  
10. They say, “Are we to be restored to the 
original condition?  
11. When we have become hollow bones?”  
12. They say,  “This is a losing proposition.”  
13. But it will be only a single nudge.  
14. And they will be awake.  
15. Has the story of Moses reached you?  
16. When His Lord called out to him in the sa-
cred valley of Tuwa.  
17. “Go to Pharaoh— he has transgressed.”  
18. And  say, “Do you care to be cleansed?  
19. And I will guide you to your Lord, and you 
will turn reverent.”  
20. He showed him the Greatest Miracle.  
21. But he denied and defied.  
22. Then turned his back, and tried.  
23. And gathered and proclaimed.  
24. He said, “I am your Lord, the most high.”  
25. So Allah seized him with an exemplary 
punishment, in the last and in the first.  
26. In this is a lesson for whoever fears.  27. Are you more difficult to create, or the 
heaven? He constructed it.  
28. He raised its masses , and proportioned it.  
29. And He dimmed its night, and brought out 
its daylight.  
30. And the earth after that He spread.  
31. And from it, He produced its water and its 
pasture.  
32. And the mountains, He anchored.  
33. A source of enjoyment for you and for your 
animals.  
34. But when the Great Cataclysm arrives.  
35. A Day when man will remember what he 
has endeavored.  
36. And Hell will be displayed to whoever sees.  
37. As for him who was defiant.  
38. And preferred the life of this world.  
39. Then Hell is the shelter.  
40. But as for him who feared the Standing of 
his Lord, and restrained the self from desires.  
41. Then Paradise is the shelter.  
42. They ask you about the Hour, “When will 
it take place?”  
43. You have no knowledge of it.  
44. To your Lord is its fi nality.  
45. You are just a warner for whoever dreads 
it. 
46. On the Day when they witness it —as 
though they only stayed an evening, or its morning.  
  
## 80. HE FROWNED  (‘Abasa ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. He frowned and turned away.  
2. When the blind man approached him.  
3. But how do you know? Perhaps he was 
seeking to purify himself.
