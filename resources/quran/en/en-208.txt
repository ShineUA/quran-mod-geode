## 56.  THE INEVITABLE   (al-Waqi’ah)  
44. Neither cool, nor refreshing.  
45. They had lived before that in luxury.  
46. And they used to persist in immense 
wrongdoing.  
47. And they used to say, “When we are dead 
and turned into dust and bones, are we to be 
resurrected?  
48. And our ancient ancestors too?”  
49. Say, “The first and the last.  
50. Will be gathered for the appointment of a 
familiar Day.”  
51. Then you, you misguided, who deny the 
truth.  
52. Will be eating from the Tree of Bitterness.  
53. Will be filling your bellies with it.  
54. Will be drinking on top of it boiling water.  
55. Drinking like thirsty camels drink.  
56. That is their hospitality on the Day of Ret-
ribution.  
57. We created you —if only you would be-
lieve!  
58. Have you seen what you ejaculate?  
59. Is it you who create it, or are We the Crea-
tor? 
60. We have decreed dea th among you, and 
We will not be outstripped.  
61. In replacing you with your likes, and trans-
forming you into what you do not know.  
62. You have known the first formation; if only 
you would remember.  
63. Have you seen what you cultivate?  
64. Is it you who make it grow, or are We the 
Grower?  
65. If We will, We can turn it into rubble; then 
you will lament.  
66. “We are penalized.  
67. No, we are being deprived.”  
68. Have you seen the water you drink?  
69. Is it you who sent it down from the clouds, 
or are We th e Sender?  70. If We will, We can make it salty. Will you 
not be thankful?  
71. Have you seen the fire you kindle?  
72. Is it you who produce its tree, or are We 
the Producer?  
73. We have made it a reminder, and a comfort 
for the users.  
74. So glorify the Name of your Great Lord.  
75. I swear by the locations of the stars.  
76. It is an oath, if you only knew, that is tre-
mendous.  
77. It is a noble Quran.  
78. In a well -protected Book.  
79. None can grasp it except the purified.  
80. A revelation from the Lord of  the Worlds.  
81. Is it this discourse that you take so lightly?  
82. And you make it your livelihood to deny it?  
83. So when it has reached the throat.  
84. As you are looking on.  
85. We are nearer to it than you are, but you 
do not see.  
86. If you are not h eld to account.  
87. Then bring it back, if you are truthful.  
88. But if he is one of those brought near.  
89. Then happiness, and flowers, and Garden 
of Delights.  
90. And if he is one of those on the Right.  
91. Then, “Peace upon you,” from those on the 
Righ t. 
92. But if he is one of the deniers, the mistaken.  
93. Then a welcome of Inferno.  
94. And burning in Hell.  
95. This is the certain truth.  
96. So glorify the Name of your Lord, the Mag-
nificent
