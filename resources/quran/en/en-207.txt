## 56. THE INEVITABLE (al-Waqi’ah ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. When the inevitable occurs.  
2. Of its occurrence, there is no denial.  
3. Bringing low, raising high.  
4. When the eart h is shaken with a shock.  
5. And the mountains are crushed and crum-
bled.  
6. And they become scattered dust.  
7. And you become three classes.  
8. Those on the Right— what of those on the 
Right?  
9. And those on the Left— what of those on the 
Left?  
10. And the f orerunners, the forerunners.  11. Those are the nearest.  
12. In the Gardens of Bliss.  
13. A throng from the ancients.  
14. And a small band from the latecomers.  
15. On luxurious furnishings.  
16. Reclining on them, facing one another.  
17. Serving them will be immortalized youth.  
18. With cups, pitchers, and sparkling drinks.  
19. Causing them neither headache, nor intox-
ication.  
20. And fruits of their choice.  
21. And meat of birds that they may desire.  
22. And lovely companions.  
23. The likenesses of treasured pearls.  
24. As a reward for what they used to do.  
25. Therein they will hear no nonsense, and no 
accusations.  
26. But only the greeting: “Peace, peace.”  
27. And those on the Right —what of those on 
the Right?  
28. In lush orchards.  
29. And sweet -smelling plants.  
30. And extended shade.  
31. And outpouring water.  
32. And abundant fruit.  
33. Neither withheld, nor forbidden.  
34. And uplifted mattresses.  
35. We have created them of special creation.  
36. And made them virgins.  
37. Tender and un- aging.  
38. For those on the Right.  
39. A throng from the ancients.  
40. And a throng from the latecomers.  
41. And those on the Left— what of those on 
the Left?  
42. Amid searing wind and boiling water.  
43. And a shadow of thick smoke.
