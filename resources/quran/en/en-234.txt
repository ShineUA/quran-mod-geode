## 85. THE CONSTELLATIONS  (al-Buruj ) 
4. Destroyed were the People of the Trench . 
5. The fire supplied with fuel.  
6. While they sat around it.  
7. And were witnessing what they did to the 
believers.  
8. They begrudged them only because they be-
lieved in Allah the Almighty, the Praisewor-
thy. 
9. To Whom belongs the sovereignty of the 
heav ens and the earth. Allah is witness over 
everything.  
10. Those who tempt the believers, men and 
women, then do not repent; for them is the 
punishment of Hell; for them is the punish-
ment of Burning.  
11. Those who believe and do righteous deeds 
will have Gar dens beneath which rivers flow. 
That is the great triumph.  
12. The onslaught of your Lord is severe.  
13. It is He who begins and repeats.  
14. And He is the Forgiving, the Loving.  
15. Possessor of the Glorious Throne.  
16. Doer of whatever He wills.  
17. Has there come to you the story of the le-
gions? 
18. Of Pharaoh and Thamood?  
19. In fact, those who disbelieve are in denial.  
20. And Allah encloses them from beyond.  
21. In fact, it is a Glorious Quran.  
22. In a Preserved Tablet.  
  
## 86. THE NIGHTLY VISITOR  (at-Tariq ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. By the sky and at -Tariq.  
2. But what will let you know what at- Tariq is?  
3. The Piercing Star.  
4. There is no soul without a Protector over it.  5. Let man consider what he was created from.  
6. He was created from gushing liquid.  
7. Issuing from between the backbone and the 
breastbones.  
8. He is certainly able to return him.  
9. On the Day when the secrets are disclosed.  
10. He will have no strength, and no supporter.  
11. By the sky that returns.  
12. And the earth that cracks open.  
13. It is a Decisive Word.  
14. It is no joke.  
15. They plot and scheme.  
16. But I plot and scheme.  
17. Therefore, give the blasphemers respite, a 
brief respite.

4. He who produces the pasture.  
5. And then turns it into light debris.  
6. We will make you read, so do not forget.  
7. Except what Allah wills. He knows what is 
declared, and what is hidden.  
8. We will ease you into the Easy Way.  
9. So remind, if reminding helps.  
10. The reverent will remember.  
11. But the wretched will avoid it.  
12. He who will enter the Gigantic Fire.  
13. Where he will neither die, nor live.  
14. Successful is he who purifies himself.
