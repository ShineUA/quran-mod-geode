## 26.  THE POETS   (ash-Shu’ara’)  
12. He said, “My Lord, I fear they will reject 
me. 
13. And I become stressed, and my tongue is 
not fluent, so send Aaron too.  
14. And they have a c harge against me, so I fear 
they will kill me.”  
15. He said, “No. Go, both of you, with Our 
proofs. We will be with you, listening.  
16. Go to Pharaoh, and say, ‘We are the Mes-
sengers of the Lord of the Worlds.  
17. Let the Children of Israel go with us.'“  
18. He said, “Did we not raise you among us as 
a child, and you stayed among us for many of 
your years?  
19. And you committed that deed you com-
mitted, and you were ungrateful.”  
20. He said, “I did it then, when I was of those 
astray.  
21. And I fled from you  when I feared you; but 
my Lord gave me wisdom, and made me one 
of the messengers.  
22. Is that the favor you taunt me with, alt-
hough you have enslaved the Children of Is-
rael?”  
23. Pharaoh said, “And what is the Lord of the 
Worlds?”  
24. He said, “The Lord o f the heavens and the 
earth, and everything between them, if you 
are aware.”  
25. He said to those around him, “Do you not 
hear?”  
26. He said, “Your Lord and the Lord of your 
ancestors of old.”  
27. He said, “This messenger of yours, who is 
sent to you, is c razy.”  
28. He said, “Lord of the East and the West, 
and everything between them, if you under-
stand.”  
29. He said, “If you accept any god other than 
me, I will make you a prisoner.” 
30. He said, “What if I bring you something 
convincing?”  31. He said, “Bring it, if you are being truthful.”  
32. So he cast his staff; and it was a serpent, 
plain to see.  
33. And he pulled his hand; and it was white, 
for all to see.  
34. He said to the dignitaries around him, 
“This is a skilled magician.  
35. He intends to drive you out of your land 
with his magic, so what do you recommend?”  
36. They said, “Delay him and his brother, and 
send recruiters to the cities.  
37. To bring you every experienced magician.”  
38. So the magicians were gathered for the ap-
pointment on a sp ecified day.  
39. And it was said to the people, “Are you all 
gathered?  
40. That we may follow the magicians, if they 
are the winners.”  
41. When the magicians arrived, they said to 
Pharaoh, “Is there a reward for us, if we are the winners?”  
42. He said, “Ye s, and you will be among those 
favored.”  
43. Moses said to them, “Present what you in-
tend to present.”  
44. So they threw their ropes and their sticks, 
and said, “By the majesty of Pharaoh, we will 
be the winners.”  
45. Then Moses threw his staff, and behold , it 
began swallowing their trickery.  
46. And the magicians fell down prostrating.  
47. They said, “We have believed in the Lord 
of the Worlds.  
48. The Lord of Moses and Aaron.”  
49. He said, “Did you believe in Him before I 
have given you permission? He mus t be your 
chief, who taught you magic. You will soon 
know. I will cut off your hands and feet on 
opposite sides, and I will crucify you all.”  
50. They said, “No problem. To our Lord we 
will return.
