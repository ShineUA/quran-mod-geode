follows me. Glory be to Allah; and I am not 
of the polytheists.”  
109. We did not send before you except men, 
whom We inspired, from the people of the 
towns. Have they not roamed the earth and 
seen the consequences for those before them? 
The Home of the Hereafter is better for those 
who are righteous. Do you not understand?  
110. Until, when the messengers have des-
paired, and thought that they were rejected, 
Our help  came to them. We save whomever 
We will, and Our severity is not averted from 
the guilty people.  
111. In their stories is a lesson for those who 
possess intelligence. This is not a fabricated 
tale, but a confirmation of what came before it, and a detailed explanation of all things, 
and guidance, and mercy for people who be-
lieve.  
  
## 13. THUNDER  (ar-Ra’d ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Alif, Lam, Meem, Ra. These are the signs of 
the Scripture. What is revealed to you from 
your Lord is the truth, but most people do not 
believe.  
2. Allah is He who raised the heavens without 
pillars that you can see, and then settled on 
the Throne. And He regulated the sun and 
the moon, each running for a specified pe-
riod. He manages all affairs, and He explai ns 
the signs, that you may be certain of the meet-
ing with your Lord.  
3. And it is He who spread the earth, and 
placed in it mountains and rivers. And He 
placed in it two kinds of every fruit. He causes 
the night to overlap the day. In that are signs 
for pe ople who reflect.  
4. On earth are adjacent terrains, and gardens 
of vines, and crops, and date -palms, from the 
same root or from distinct roots, irrigated 
with the same water. We make some taste better than others. In that are proofs for peo-
ple who reason.  
5. Should you wonder —the real wonder is 
their saying: “When we have become dust, 
will we be in a new creation?” Those are they 
who defied their Lord. Those are they who 
will have yokes around their necks. Those are 
the inhabitants of the Fire, where they will re-
main forever.  
6. And they urge you to hasten evil before 
good, though examples have passed away be-
fore them. Your Lord is full of forgiveness to-wards the people for their wrongdoings, yet 
your Lord is severe in retribution.  
7. Those who disbelieve s ay, “Why was a mir-
acle not sent down to him from his Lord?” You are only a warner, and to every commu-
nity is a guide.  
8. Allah knows what every female bears, and 
every increase and decrease of the wombs. 
With Him, everything is by measure.  
9. The Knower of  the Invisible and the Visible; 
the Grand, the Supreme.  
10. It is the same; whether one of you conceals 
his speech, or declares it; whether he goes into hiding by night, or goes out by day.  
11. He has a succession; before him and behind 
him, protecting him  by Allah’s command. 
Allah does not change the condition of a peo-
ple until they change what is within them-
selves. And if Allah wills any hardship for a 
people, there is no turning it back; and apart 
from Him they have no protector.  
12. It is He who shows y ou the lightening, 
causing fear and hope. And He produces the heavy clouds.  
13. The thunder praises His glory, and so do 
the angels, in awe of Him. And He sends the 
thunderbolts, striking with them whomever 
He wills. Yet they argue about Allah, while 
He is  Tremendous in might.  
14. To Him belongs the call to truth. Those 
they call upon besides Him do not respond to 
them with anything —except as someone who 
stretches his hands towards water, so that it
