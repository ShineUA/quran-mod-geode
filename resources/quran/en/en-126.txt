## 22.  THE PILGRIMAGE   (al-Hajj) 
66. And it is He who gives you life, then makes 
you die, then revives you. The human being 
is unappreciative.  
67. For every congregati on We have appointed 
acts of devotion, which they observe. So do 
not let them dispute with you in this matter. 
And invite to your Lord; you are upon a 
straight guidance.  
68. But if they dispute with you, say, “Allah is 
fully aware of what you do.”  
69. Allah will judge between you on the Day of 
Resurrection regarding what you disagree 
about.  
70. Do you not know that Allah knows every-
thing in the heavens and the earth? This is in 
a book. That is easy for Allah.  
71. Yet they worship, besides Allah, things for 
which He sent down no warrant, and what 
they have no knowledge of. There is no savior 
for the transgressors.  
72. And when Our Clear Verses are recited to 
them, you will recognize disgust on the faces 
of those who disbelieve. They nearly assault 
those who r ecite to them Our Verses. Say, 
“Shall I inform you of something worse than 
that? The Fire! Allah has promised it to those 
who disbelieve. And what a wretched out-
come!”  
73. O people! A parable is presented, so listen 
to it: Those you invoke besides Allah wi ll 
never create a fly, even if they banded to-
gether for that purpose. And if the fly steals 
anything from them, they cannot recover it 
from it. Weak are the pursuer and the pur-
sued.  
74. They do not value Allah as He should be 
valued. Allah is Strong and Po werful.  
75. Allah chooses messengers from among the 
angels, and from among the people. Allah is Hearing and Seeing.  
76. He knows what is before them, and what is 
behind them. To Allah all matters are re-
ferred.  77. O you who believe! Kneel, and prostrate, 
and worship your Lord, and do good deeds, 
so that you may succeed.  
78. And strive for Allah, with the striving due 
to Him. He has chosen you, and has not bur-dened you in religion —the faith of your fa-
ther Abraham. It is he who named you Mus-
lims before, and in this. So that the Messen-
ger may be a witness over you, and you may 
be witnesses over the people. So pray regu-
larly, and give regular charity, and cleave to Allah. He is your Protector. What an excel-
lent Protector, and what an excellent Helper.  
  
## 23. THE BELIEVERS  (al-Mu’minun ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Successful are the believers.  
2. Those who are humble in their prayers.  
3. Those who avoid nonsense.  
4. Those who work for charity.  
5. Those who safeguard their chastity.  
6. Except  from their spouses, or their depend-
ents—for then they are free from blame.  
7. But whoever seeks anything beyond that —
these are the transgressors.  
8. Those who are faithful to their trusts and 
pledges.  
9. Those who safeguard their prayers.  
10. These are the inheritors.  
11. Who will inherit Paradise, wherein they 
will dwell forever.  
12. We created man from an extract of clay.  
13. Then We made him a seed, in a secure re-
pository.  
14. Then We developed the seed into a clot. 
Then We developed the clot into a l ump. 
Then We developed the lump into bones. 
Then We clothed the bones with flesh. Then 
We produced it into another creature. Most 
Blessed is Allah, the Best of Creators.
