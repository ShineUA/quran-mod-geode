## 11.  HUD   (Hud)  
pursued the luxuries they were indulged in, 
and thus became guilty.  
117. Your Lord would never destroy the towns 
wrongfully, while their inhabitants are right-
eous.  
118. Had your Lord willed, He could have 
made humanity one community, but they 
continue to differ.  
119. Except those on whom your Lord has  
mercy —for that reason He created them. The 
Word of your Lord is final: “I will fill Hell 
with jinn and humans, altogether.”  
120. Everything We narrate to you of the his-
tory of the messengers is to strengthen your 
heart therewith. The truth has come to you  in 
this, and a lesson, and a reminder for the be-
lievers.  
121. And say to those who do not believe, “Act 
according to your ability; and so will we.”  
122. “And wait; we too are waiting.”  
123. To Allah belongs the future of the heavens 
and the earth, and to Him all authority goes 
back. So worship Him, and rely on Him. 
Your Lord is never unaware of what you do.  
  
## 12. JOSEPH  (Yusuf ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Alif, Lam, Ra. These are the Verses of the 
Clear Book.  
2. We have revealed it an Arabic Quran, so 
that you may understand.  
3. We narrate to you the most accurate his-
tory, by revealing to you this Quran. Alt-
hough, prior to it, you were of the unaware.  
4. When Joseph said to his father, “O my fa-
ther, I saw eleven planets, and the sun,  and 
the moon; I saw them bowing down to me.”  
5. He said, “O my son, do not relate your vi-
sion to your brothers, lest they plot and 
scheme against you. Satan is man's sworn en-
emy.  6. And thus your Lord will choose you, and 
will teach you the interpretation  of events, 
and will complete His blessing upon you and 
upon the family of Jacob, as He has com-
pleted it before upon your forefathers Abra-
ham and Isaac. Your Lord is Knowing and 
Wise.  
7. In Joseph and his brothers are lessons for 
the seekers.  
8. When they said, “Joseph and his brother are 
dearer to our father than we are, although we 
are a whole group. Our father is obviously in 
the wrong.  
9. “Kill Joseph, or throw him somewhere in 
the land, and your father‘s attention will be 
yours. Afterwards, you will be  decent peo-
ple.”  
10. One of them said, “Do not kill Joseph, but 
throw him into the bottom of the well; some caravan may pick him up —if you must do 
something.”  
11. They said, “Father, why do you not trust us 
with Joseph, although we care for him?”  
12. “Send  him with us tomorrow, that he may 
roam and play; we will take care of him.”  
13. He said, “It worries me that you would take 
him away. And I fear the wolf may eat him 
while you are careless of him.”  
14. They said, “If the wolf ate him, and we are 
many, we would be good for nothing.”  
15. So they went away with him, and agreed to 
put him at the bottom of the well. And We 
inspired him, “You will inform them of this 
deed of theirs when they are unaware.”  
16. And they came to their father in the even-
ing weeping.  
17. They said, “O father, we went off racing 
one another, and left Joseph by our belong-
ings; and the wolf ate him. But you will not believe us, even though we are being truth-
ful.”  
18. And they brought his shirt, with fake blood 
on it. He said, “Your souls  enticed you to do 
something. But patience is beautiful, and Al-
lah is my Help against what you describe.”
