## 14.  ABRAHAM   (Ibrahim)
50. Their garments made of tar, and the Fire 
covering their faces.  
51. That Allah may repay each soul according 
to what it has earned. Allah is Quick in reck-
oning.  
52. This is a proclamation for mankind, that 
they may be warned thereby, and know that 
He is One God, and that people of under-
standing may remember.  
  
## 15. THE ROCK  (al-Hijr) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Alif, Lam, Ra. These are the Verses of the 
Book; a Quran that makes things clear.  
2. Perhaps those who disbelieve would like to 
become Muslims.  
3. Leave them to eat, and enjoy, and be lulled 
by hope. They will find out.  
4. We have never destroyed a town unless it 
had a set time.  
5. No nation can b ring its time forward, nor 
can they delay it.  
6. And they said, “O you who received the 
message, you are insane.”  
7. Why do you not bring us the angels, if you 
are truthful?”  
8. We do not send the angels down except 
with reason, and they will not be held b ack. 
9. Surely We revealed the Message, and We 
will surely preserve it.  
10. We sent others before you, to the former 
communities.  
11. But no messenger came to them, but they 
ridiculed him.  
12. Thus We slip it into the hearts of the guilty.  
13. They do not believe in it, though the ways 
of the ancients have passed away.  
14. Even if We opened for them a gateway into 
the sky, and they began to ascend through it.  15. They would still say, “Our eyes are halluci-
nating; in fact, we are people bewitched.”  
16. We p laced constellations in the sky, and 
made them beautiful to the beholders.  
17. And We guarded them from every outcast 
devil.  
18. Except one who steals a hearing, and is fol-
lowed by a visible projectile.  
19. We spread the earth, and placed stabilizers 
in it, and in it We grew all things in proper 
measure.  
20. And in it We created livelihoods for you, 
and for those for whom you are not the pro-
viders.  
21. There is not a thing but with Us are its 
stores, and We send it down only in precise 
measure.  
22. We send the fertilizing winds; and send 
down water from the sky, and give it to you 
to drink, and you are not the ones who store 
it. 
23. It is We who give life and cause death, and 
We are the Inheritors.  
24. And We know those of you who go for-
ward, and We know those who lag behind.  
25. It is your Lord who will gather them to-
gether. He is the Wise, the Knowing.  
26. We created the human being from clay, 
from molded mud.  
27. And the jinn We created before, from 
piercing fire.  
28. Your Lord said to the angels, “I am  creating 
a human being from clay, from molded 
mud.”  
29. “When I have formed him, and breathed 
into him of My spirit, fall down prostrating 
before him.”  
30. So the angels prostrated themselves, all to-
gether.  
31. Except for Satan. He refused to be among 
those who prostrated themselves.
