## 37.  THE ALIGNERS   (as-Saffat)  
26. In fact, on that Day, they will be submis-
sive.  
27. They will come to one another, question-
ing one another.  
28. They will say, “You used to come at us 
from the right.”  
29. They will say, “You yourselves were not be-
lievers.  
30. We had no authority over you. You your-
selves were rebellious people.  
31. The Word of our Lord has been realized 
against us. We are tasting it.  
32. We seduced you. We were seducers.”  
33. On that Day, they will share in the punish-
ment.  
34. Thus We deal with the sinners.  
35. When it was said to them, “There is no god 
except Allah,” they grew arrogant.  
36. And said, “Are we to abandon our gods for 
a mad poet?”  
37. In fact, he came with the truth, and he con-
firmed the messengers.  
38. Most assuredly, you will taste the painful 
punishment.  
39. And you will be repaid only for what you 
used to do.  
40. Except for Allah’s sincere servants.  
41. For them is a known provision.  
42. Fruits; and they wi ll be honored.  
43. In the Gardens of Bliss.  
44. On furnishings, facing one another.  
45. They will be offered a cup of pure drink.  
46. White; a delight to those who drink.  
47. Never polluted, and never intoxicating.  
48. With them will be bashful women with 
lovely eyes.  
49. As if they were closely guarded pearls.  
50. Then they will approach one another, 
questioning.  51. One of them will say, “I used to have a 
friend.  
52. Who used to say, “Are you of those who 
believe?  
53. That after we die and become dust and  
bones, we will be called to account?”  
54. He will say, “Will you have a look?”  
55. He will look, and will see him in the pit of 
Hell.  
56. He will say, “By Allah, you almost ruined 
me. 
57. Were it not for the grace of my Lord, I 
would have been among the arraigned.”  
58. “We will not die.  
59. Except for our first death, and we will not 
be punished.”  
60. This is the supreme triumph.  
61. For the like of this let the workers work.  
62. Is this a better hospitality, or the Tree of 
Bitterness?  
63. We made it an ordeal for the unjust.  
64. It is a tree that grows from the bottom of 
Hell.  
65. Its fruits are like the devils’ heads.  
66. They will eat from it, and fill their bellies 
with it.  
67. Then, on top of it, they will have a brew of 
boiling liquid.  
68. Then their return will be to the Blaze.  
69. They had found their parents astray.  
70. And rushed along in their footsteps.  
71. And most of the ancients before them went 
astray.  
72. Even though We sent messengers to warn 
them.  
73. So observe the end of those who were  
warned.  
74. Except for the sincere servants of Allah.  
75. And Noah called out to Us, and We are the 
Best of responders.
