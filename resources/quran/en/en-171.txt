## 37.  THE ALIGNERS   (as-Saffat)  
123. Also Elijah was one of the messengers.  
124. He said to his people, “Do you not fear?  
125. Do you call on Baal, and forsake the Best 
of creators?  
126. Allah is your Lord, and the Lord of your 
ancestors.”  
127. But they called him a liar, and thus they 
will be brought forward.  
128. Except for Allah’s sincere servants.  
129. And We left with him for later genera-
tions.  
130. Peace be upon the House of Elijah.  
131. Thus We reward the virtuous.  
132. He was one of Our believing servants.  
133. And Lot was one of the messengers.  
134. We saved him and his family, all of them.  
135. Except for an old woma n who lagged be-
hind.  
136. Then We annihilated the others.  
137. You pass by them in the morning.  
138. And at night. Do you not understand?  
139. And Jonah was one of the messengers.  
140. When he fled to the laden boat.  
141. He gambled and lost.  
142. Then the  fish swallowed him, and he was 
to blame.  
143. Had he not been one of those who praised.  
144. He would have stayed in its belly until the 
Day they are raised.  
145. Then We threw him into the wilderness, 
and he was sick.  
146. And We made a gourd tree grow over him.  
147. Then We sent him to a hundred thousand, 
or more.  
148. And they believed, so We gave them en-
joyment for a while.  
149. Ask them, “Are the daughters for your 
Lord, while for them the sons?”  150. Or did We create the angels females, as 
they witn essed?”  
151. No indeed! It is one of their lies when they 
say. 
152. “Allah has begotten.” They are indeed ly-
ing. 
153. So He preferred girls over boys?  
154. What is the matter with you? How do you 
judge?  
155. Will you not reflect?  
156. Or do you have some c lear proof?  
157. Then bring your book, if you are telling 
the truth.  
158. And they invented a relationship between 
Him and the jinn. But the jinn know that they 
will be arraigned.  
159. Allah be glorified, far above what they al-
lege.  
160. Except for Allah’s  sincere servants.  
161. Surely, you and what you serve.  
162. Cannot seduce away from Him.  
163. Except for he who will be roasting in Hell.  
164. “There is not one of us but has an assigned 
position.  
165. And we are the arrangers.  
166. And we are the glorifiers.”  
167. Even though they used to say.  
168. “Had we received advice from the an-
cients.  
169. We would have been Allah's faithful serv-
ants.”  
170. But they rejected it, so they will find out.  
171. Our Word has already gone out to our 
servant messenge rs. 
172. It is they who will be supported.  
173. And Our troops will be the victors.  
174. So disregard them for a while.  
175. And watch them —they will soon see.  
176. Are they seeking to hasten Our punish-
ment?
