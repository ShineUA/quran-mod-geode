## 30.  THE ROMANS   (ar-Rum)  
41. Corruption has appeared on land and sea, 
because of what people’s hands have earned, 
in order to make them tas te some of what 
they have done, so that they might return.  
42. Say, “Roam the earth, and observe the fate 
of those who came before. Most of them were 
idolaters.”  
43. So devote yourself to the upright religion, 
before there comes from Allah a Day that 
canno t be averted. On that Day, they will be 
shocked.  
44. Whoever disbelieves, upon him falls his 
disbelief. And whoever acts righteously —
they are preparing for themselves.  
45. So that He may reward those who have be-
lieved and done the righteous deeds out of 
His bounty. Indeed, He does not love the un-
grateful.  
46. And of His signs is that He sends the winds 
bearing good news, to give you a taste of His mercy, and so that the ships may sail by His command, and so that you may seek of His 
bounty, and so that you m ay give thanks.  
47. Before you, We sent messengers to their 
people. They came to them with clear proofs. Then We took revenge on those who sinned. 
It is incumbent on Us to help the believers.  
48. Allah is He who sends the winds. They stir 
up clouds. Then H e spreads them in the sky 
as He wills. And He breaks them apart. Then 
you see rain drops issuing from their midst. 
Then, when He makes it fall upon whom He 
wills of His servants, behold, they rejoice.  
49. Although they were before this —before it 
was sent d own upon them —in despair.  
50. So observe the effects of Allah’s mercy —
how He revives the earth after it was dead. In-
deed, He is the Reviver of the dead. He is Ca-
pable of everything.  
51. But if We send a wind, and they see it turn-
ing things yellow, they would continue there-
after to disbelieve.  
52. You cannot make the dead hear, nor can 
you make the deaf hear the call when they 
turn away.  53. Nor can you guide the blind out of their er-
ror. You can make hear only those who be-
lieve in Our signs, and so have submitted.  
54. Allah is He Who created you weak, then af-
ter weakness gave you strength, then after 
strength gave you weakness and gray hair. He 
creates whatever He wills. He is the Omnisci-
ent, the Omnipotent.  
55. On the Day when the Hour takes place, the 
sinners will swear they had stayed but an 
hour. Thus they were deluded.  
56. But those endowed with knowledge and 
faith will say, “You remained in Allah’s Book 
until the Day of Resurrection. This is the Day 
of Resurrection, but you did not know.”  
57. On that  Day, the sinners’ excuses will not 
benefit them, nor will they be excused.  
58. We have cited in this Quran for the people 
every sort of parable. But even if you bring 
them a miracle, those who disbelieve will say, 
“You are nothing but fakers.”  
59. Allah t hus seals the hearts of those who do 
not know.  
60. So be patient. The promise of Allah is true. 
And do not let those who lack certainty belit-tle you.  
  
## 31. LUQMAN  (Luqman ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Alif, Lam, Meem.  
2. These are the Verses of the Wise Book.  
3. A guide and a mercy for the righteous.  
4. Those who observe the prayer, and pay the 
obligatory charity, and are certain of the 
Hereafter.  
5. These are upon guidance from their Lord. 
These are the successful.  
6. Among the pe ople is he who trades in dis-
tracting tales; intending, without knowledge, 
to lead away from Allah’s way, and to make a
