## 69. THE REALITY  (al-Haqqah )  
46. Then slashed his lifeline.  
47. And none o f you could have restrained Us 
from him.  
48. Surely, it is a message for the righteous.  
49. And We know that some of you will reject 
it. 
50. And it is surely a source of grief for the un-
believers.  
51. Yet it is the absolute truth.  
52. So glorify the name of your Lord, the Mag-
nificent.  
  
## 70. WAYS OF ASCENT  
(al-Ma’arij ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. A questioner questioned the imminent tor-
ment.  
2. For the disbelievers; none can repel it.  
3. From Allah, Lord of the Ways of Ascent.  
4. Unto Him the angels and the Spirit ascend 
on a Day the duration of which is fifty thou-
sand years.  
5. So be patient, with sweet patience.  
6. They see it distant.  
7. But We see it near.  
8. On the Day when the sky will be like molten 
brass.  
9. And the mountai ns will be like tufted wool.  
10. No friend will care about his friend.  
11. They will be shown each other. The crimi-
nal wishes he would be redeemed from the 
punishment of that Day by his children.  
12. And his spouse, and his brother.  
13. And his family that  sheltered him.  
14. And everyone on earth, in order to save 
him.  
15.  By no means! It is a Raging Fire.  
16. It strips away the scalps.  17. It invites him who once turned his back 
and fled.  
18. And accumulated and hoarded.  
19. Man was created restless.  
20. Touched by adversity, he is fretful.  
21. Touched by good, he is ungenerous.  
22. Except the prayerful.  
23. Those who are constant at their prayers.  
24. And those in whose wealth is a rightful 
share.  
25. For the beggar and the deprived.  
26. And those who affirm the Day of Judg-
ment.  
27. And those who fear the punishment of 
their Lord.  
28. Their Lord’s punishment is not to be taken 
for granted.  
29. And those who guard their chastity.  
30. Except from their spouses or those living 
under their control, for then  they are free of 
blame.  
31. But whoever seeks to go beyond that—
these are the transgressors.  
32. And those who honor their trusts and their 
pledges.  
33. And those who stand by their testimonies.  
34. And those who are dedicated to their pray-
ers. 
35. These will be honored in Gardens.  
36. What is with those who disbelieve, stretch-
ing their necks towards you.  
37. From the right, and from the left, banding 
together?  
38. Is every one of them aspiring to be admit-
ted into a Garden of Bliss?  
39. No indeed! We creat ed them from what 
they know.  
40. I swear by the Lord of the Easts and the 
Wests, that We are Able.
