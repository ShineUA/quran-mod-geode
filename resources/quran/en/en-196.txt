## 47.  MUHAMMAD   (Muhammad)  
38. Here you are, being called to spend in the 
cause of Allah. Among you are those who 
withhold; but whoever withholds is with-
holding against his own soul. Allah is the 
Rich, while you are the needy. And if you 
turn away, He will replace you with another 
people, and they will not be like you.  
  
## 48. VICTORY  (al-Fath ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. We ha ve granted you a conspicuous victory.  
2. That Allah may forgive you your sin, past 
and to come, and complete His favors upon you, and guide you in a straight path.  
3. And help you with an unwavering support.  
4. It is He who sent down tranquility into the 
hearts of the believers, to add faith to their 
faith. To Allah belong the forces of the heav-
ens and the earth. Allah is Knowing and 
Wise.  
5. He will admit the believers, male and fe-
male, into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, to abide therein forever, and He will re-
mit their sins. That, with Allah, is a great tri-
umph.  
6. And He will punish the hypocrites, male 
and female, and the idolaters, male and fe-
male, those who harbor evil thoughts about 
Allah. They are surrounded by evil; and Allah 
is angry with the m, and has cursed them, and 
has prepared for them Hell —a miserable des-
tination.  
7. To Allah belong the troops of the heavens 
and the earth. Allah is Mighty and Wise.  
8. We sent you as a witness, and a bearer of 
good news, and a warner.  
9. That you may beli eve in Allah and His Mes-
senger, and support Him, and honor Him, 
and praise Him morning and evening.  
10. Those who pledge allegiance to you are 
pledging allegiance to Allah. The hand of Al-
lah is over their hands. Whoever breaks his pledge breaks it to his own loss. And whoever fulfills his covenant with Allah, He will grant him a great reward.  
11. The Desert -Arabs who remained behind 
will say to you, “Our belongings and our fam-
ilies have preoccupied us, so ask forgiveness 
for us.” They say with their tongues  what is 
not in their hearts. Say, “Who can avail you 
anything against Allah, if He desires loss for 
you, or desires gain for you?” In fact, Allah is 
Informed of what you do.  
12. But you thought that the Messenger and 
the believers will never return to the ir fami-
lies, and this seemed fine to your hearts; and 
you harbored evil thoughts, and were uncivi-
lized people.  
13. He who does not believe in Allah and His 
Messenger —We have prepared for the disbe-
lievers a Blazing Fire.  
14. To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heav-
ens and the earth. He forgives whomever He 
wills, and He punishes whomever He wills. 
Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  
15. Those who lagged behind will say when 
you depart to collect the gains, “Let us follow 
you.” They want to change the Word of Al-
lah. Say, “You will not follow us; Allah has 
said so before.” Then they will say, “But you 
are jealous of us.” In fact, they understand 
only a little.  
16. Say to the Desert -Arabs who lagged be-
hind, “You will be called against a people of 
great might; you w ill fight them, unless they 
submit. If you obey, Allah will give you a fine 
reward. But if you turn away, as you turned 
away before, He will punish you with a pain-
ful punishment.”  
17. There is no blame on the blind, nor any 
blame on the lame, nor any blame  on the sick. 
Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger —
He will admit him into gardens beneath 
which rivers flow; but whoever turns away —
He will punish him with a painful punish-
ment.  
18. Allah was pleased with the believers, when 
they pledged allegiance to you  under the tree.
