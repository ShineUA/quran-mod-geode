## 92. THE NIGHT  (al-Layl) 
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. By the night as it covers.  
2. And the day as it reveals.  
3. And He who created the male and the fe-
male.  
4. Your endeavors are indeed diverse.  
5. As for him who gives and is righteous.  
6. And confirms goodness.  
7. We will ease his way towards ease.  
8. But as for him who is stingy and compla-
cent.  
9. And denies goodness.  
10. We will ease his way towards difficulty.  
11. And his money will not avail him when h e 
plummets.  
12. It is upon Us to guide.  
13. And to Us belong the Last and the First.  
14. I have warned you of a Fierce Blaze.  
15. None will burn in it except the very wicked.  
16. He who denies and turns away.  
17. But the devout will avoid it.  
18. He who gives his money to become pure.  
19. Seeking no favor in return.  
20. Only seeking the acceptance of his Lord, 
the Most High.  
21. And he will be satisfied.  
  
## 93. MORNING LIGHT  (adh-Duha ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. By the morning light.  
2. And the night as it settles.  
3. Your Lord did not abandon you, nor did He 
forget.  
4. The Hereafter is better for you than the 
First.  5. And your Lord will give you, and you will 
be satisfied.  
6. Did He not find you orphaned, and shel-
tered you?  
7. And found you wandering, and guided you?  
8. And found you in need, and enriched you?  
9. Therefore, do not mistreat the orphan.  
10. Nor rebuff the seeker.  
11. But proclaim the blessings of your Lord.  
  
## 94. THE SOOTHING  (ash-Sharh ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Did We not soothe your heart?  
2. And lift from you your burden.  
3. Which weighed down your back?  
4. And raised for you your reputation?  
5. With hardship comes ease.  
6. With hardship comes ease.  
7. When your work is done, turn to devotion.  
8. And to your Lord turn for everything.  
  
## 95. THE FIG  (at-Tin) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. By the fig and the olive.  
2. And Mount Sinai.  
3. And this safe land.  
4. We created man in the best design.  
5. Then reduced him to the lowest of the low.  
6. Except those who believe and do righteous 
deeds; for them is a reward without end.  
7. So why do you still reject the religion?  
8. Is Allah not the Wisest of the wise?
