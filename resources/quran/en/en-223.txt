## 70. WAYS OF ASCENT  
41. To replace them with better than they, and 
We are not to be outdone.  
42. So leave them to blunder and play, until 
they meet their Day which they are prom ised.  
43. The Day when they will emerge from the 
tombs in a rush, as though they were hurry-
ing towards a target.  
44. Their eyes cast down; overwhelmed by hu-
miliation. This is the Day which they were promised.  
  
## 71. NOAH  (Nuh ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. We sent Noah to his people: “Warn your 
people before there comes upon them a pain-ful punishment.”  
2. He said, “O my people, I am to you a clear 
warner.  
3. Worship Allah and reverence Him, and 
obey me.  
4. And He will forgive you of  your sins, and 
reprieve you until a stated term. Allah’s term 
cannot be deferred once it has arrived, if you 
only knew.”  
5. He said, “My Lord, I have called my people 
night and day.  
6. But my call added only to their flight.  
7. Whenever I called them to Y our for-
giveness, they thrust their fingers into their 
ears, and wrapped themselves in their gar-ments, and insisted, and became more and 
more arrogant.  
8. Then I called them openly.  
9. Then I appealed to them publicly, and I 
spoke to them privately.  
10. I said, ‘Ask your Lord for forgiveness; He is 
Forgiving.  
11. He will let loose the sky upon you in tor-
rents.  12. And provide you with wealth and children, 
and allot for you gardens, and allot for you 
rivers.  
13. What is the matter with you, that you do 
not a ppreciate Allah’s Greatness?  
14. Although He created you in stages.  
15. Do you not realize that Allah created seven 
heavens in layers?  
16. And He set the moon in their midst for 
light, and He made the sun a lamp.  
17. And Allah germinated you from the earth  
like plants.  
18. Then He will return you into it, and will 
bring you out again.  
19. And Allah made the earth a spread for you.  
20. That you may travel its diverse roads.’”  
21. Noah said, “My Lord, they have defied me, 
and followed him whose wealth and chi ldren 
increase him only in perdition.” 
22. And they schemed outrageous schemes.  
23. And they said, “Do not give up your gods; 
do not give up Wadd, nor Souwa, nor 
Yaghoos, and Yaooq, and Nassr.  
24. They have misled many, so do not increase 
the wrongdoers ex cept in confusion.”  
25. Because of their wrongs, they were 
drowned, and were hurled into a Fire. They did not find apart from Allah any helpers.  
26. Noah said, “My Lord, do not leave of the 
unbelievers a single dweller on earth.  
27. If You leave them, they  will mislead your 
servants, and will breed only wicked unbe-lievers.  
28. My Lord! Forgive me and my parents, and 
anyone who enters my home in faith, and all the believing men and believing women; and 
do not increase the wrongdoers except in 
perdition.”
