## 60. THE WOMAN TESTED  (al-Mumtahina )   
9. But Allah prohibits you from befriending 
those who fought against you over your reli-
gion, and expelled you from your homes, and 
aided in your ex pulsion. Whoever takes them 
for friends —these are the wrongdoers.  
10. O you who believe! When believing 
women come to you emigrating, test them. 
Allah is Aware of their faith. And if you find 
them to be faithful, do not send them back to 
the unbelievers. They are not lawful for them, 
nor are they lawful for them. But give them what they have spent. You are not at fault if 
you marry them, provided you give them 
their compensation. And do not hold on to 
ties with unbelieving women, but demand 
what you have sp ent, and let them demand 
what they have spent. This is the rule of Allah; 
He rules among you. Allah is Knowing and 
Wise.  
11. If any of your wives desert you to the unbe-
lievers, and you decide to penalize them, give 
those whose wives have gone away the equi v-
alent of what they had spent. And fear Allah, 
in whom you are believers.  
12. O prophet! If believing women come to 
you, pledging allegiance to you, on condition 
that they will not associate anything with Al-
lah, nor steal, nor commit adultery, nor kill 
their children, nor commit perjury as to 
parenthood, nor disobey you in anything righteous, accept their allegiance and ask Al-
lah’s forgiveness for them. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  
13. O you who believe! Do not befriend people 
with whom Allah has become  angry, and 
have despaired of the Hereafter, as the faith-
less have despaired of the occupants of the 
graves.  
  
## 61. COLUMN  (as-Saff) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Everything in the heavens and the earth 
praises Allah. He is the Almighty, the Wise.  2. O you who believe! Why do you say what 
you do not do?  
3. It is most hateful to Allah that you say what 
you do not do.  
4. Allah loves those who fight in His cause, in 
ranks, as though they were a compact struc-
ture.  
5. When Moses said to his people, “O my peo-
ple, why do you hurt me, although you know 
that I am Allah’s Messenger to you?” And when they swerved, Allah swerved their 
hearts. Allah does not guide the sinful people.  
6. And when Jesus son of Mary said, “O Chil-
dren of Israel, I am Allah’s Messenger to you, confirming what preceded me of the Torah, 
and announcing good news of a messenger 
who will come after me, whose name is Ah-
mad.” But when he showed them the mira-
cles, they said, “This is obvious sorcery.”  
7. And who is a greater wrongdoer than he 
who attributes falsehoods to Allah, when he 
is being invited to Islam? Allah does not 
guide the wrongdoing people.  
8. They want to extinguish Allah’s Light with 
their mouths; but Allah will complete His 
Light, even though the disbelievers dislike it.  
9. It is He who sent His Messenger with the 
guidance and the true religion, to make it 
prevail over all religions, even though the 
idolaters dislike it.  
10. O you who believe! Shall I inform you of a 
trade that will save you f rom a painful tor-
ment?  
11. That you believe in Allah and His Messen-
ger, and strive in the cause of Allah with your 
possessions and yourselves. That is best for 
you, if you only knew.  
12. He will forgive you your sins; and will ad-
mit you into gardens beneat h which rivers 
flow, and into beautiful mansions in the Gar-dens of Eden. That is the supreme success.  
13. And something else you love: support from 
Allah, and imminent victory. So give good 
news to the believers.
