## 53.  THE STAR   (an-Najm)  
18. He saw some of the Great Signs of his Lord.  
19. Have you considered al -Lat and al -Uzza?  
20. And Manat, the third one, the other?  
21. Are you to have the males, and He the fe-
males?  
22. What a bizarre distribution.  
23. These are nothing but names, which you 
have devised, you and your ancestors, for 
which Allah sent down no authority. They follow nothing but assumptions, and what 
the ego desires, ev en though guidance has 
come to them from their Lord.  
24. Or is the human being to have whatever he 
desires?  
25. To Allah belong the Last and the First.  
26. How many an angel is there in the heavens 
whose intercession avails nothing, except af-
ter Allah give s permission to whomever He 
wills, and approves?  
27. Those who do not believe in the Hereafter 
give the angels the names of females.  
28. They have no knowledge of that. They only 
follow assumptions, and assumptions are no 
substitute for the truth.  
29. So a void him who has turned away from 
Our remembrance, and desires nothing but the present life.  
30. That is the extent of their knowledge. Your 
Lord knows best who has strayed from His 
path, and He knows best who has accepted 
guidance.  
31. To Allah belongs wh atever is in the heav-
ens and whatever is on earth. He will repay 
those who do evil according to their deeds, 
and recompense those who do good with the 
best.  
32. Those who avoid gross sins and indecen-
cies—except for minor lapses —your Lord is 
of Vast Forgive ness. He knows you well, ever 
since He created you from the earth, and ever 
since you were embryos in your mothers’ 
wombs. So do not acclaim your own virtue; 
He is fully aware of the righteous.  33. Have you considered him who turned 
away?  
34. And gave a little, and held back?  
35. Does he possess knowledge of the unseen, 
and can therefore foresee?  
36. Or was he not informed of what is in the 
Scrolls of Moses?  
37. And of Abraham, who fulfilled?  
38. That no soul bears the burdens of another 
soul.  
39. And that the human being attains only 
what he strives for.  
40. And that his efforts will be witnessed.  
41. Then he will be rewarded for it the fullest 
reward.  
42. And that to your Lord is the finality.  
43. And that it is He who causes laughter and 
weeping.  
44. And that it is He who gives death and life.  
45. And that it is He who created the two 
kinds —the male and the female.  
46. From a sperm drop, when emitted.  
47. And that upon Him is the next existence.  
48. And that it is He who enriches and impov-
erishes.  
49. And that it is He who is the Lord of Sirius.  
50. And that it is He who destroyed the first 
Aad.  
51. And Thamood, sparing no one.  
52. And the people of Noah before that; for 
they were most unjust and most oppressive.  
53. And He toppled the ruined cities.  
54. And covered them with whatever covered 
them.  
55. So which of your Lord's marvels can you 
deny?  
56. This is a warning, just like the first warn-
ings.  
57. The inevitable is imminent.  
58. None besides Allah can unveil it.
