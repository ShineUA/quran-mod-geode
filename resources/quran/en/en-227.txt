## 75. RESURRECTION  (al-Qiyamah )   
15. Even as he presents his excuses.  
16. Do not wag your tongue with it, to hurry 
on with it.  
17. Upon Us is its collection and its recitation.  
18. Then, when We have recited it, follow its 
recitation.  
19. Then upon Us is its expl anation.  
20. Alas, you love the fleeting life.  
21. And you disregard the Hereafter.  
22. Faces on that Day will be radiant.  
23. Looking towards their Lord.  
24. And faces on that Day will be gloomy.  
25. Realizing that a back -breaker has befallen 
them.  
26. Indeed, when it has reached the breast -
bones.  
27. And it is said, “Who is the healer?”  
28. And He realizes that it is the parting.  
29. And leg is entwined with leg.  
30. To your Lord on that Day is the drive.  
31. He neither believed nor prayed.  
32. But he denied and turned away.  
33. Then he went to his family, full of pride.  
34. Woe to you; and woe.  
35. Then again: Woe to you; and woe.  
36. Does man think that he will be left without 
purpose?  
37. Was he not a drop of ejaculated semen?  
38. Then he became a cl ot. And He created and 
proportioned?  
39. And made of him the two sexes, the male 
and the female?  
40. Is He not Able to revive the dead?  
  
## 76. MAN  (al-Insan)  
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  1. Has there come upon man a period of time 
when he was nothing to be mentioned?  
2. We created man from a liquid mixture, to 
test him; and We made him hearing and see-
ing. 
3. We guided him to the way, be he apprecia-
tive or unappreciative.  
4. We have prepared for the faithless chains, 
and yokes, and a Sear ing Fire.  
5. But the righteous will drink from a cup 
whose mixture is aroma.  
6. A spring from which the servants of Allah 
will drink, making it gush abundantly.  
7. They fulfill their vows, and dread a Day 
whose ill is widespread.  
8. And they feed, for the love of Him, the poor, 
and the orphan, and the captive.  
9. “We only feed you for the sake of Allah. We 
want from you neither compensation, nor 
gratitude.  
10. We dread from our Lord a frowning grim 
Day.”  
11. So Allah will protect them from the ills of 
that Day, and will grant them radiance and 
joy. 
12. And will reward them for their patience 
with a Garden and silk.  
13. Reclining therein on the thrones; experi-
encing therein neither sun, nor frost.  
14. Its shade hovering over them, and its fruit 
brought low wi thin reach.  
15. Passing around them are vessels of silver, 
and cups of crystal.  
16. Crystal of silver —they measured them ex-
actly.  
17. They will be served therein with a cup 
whose flavor is Zanjabeel.  
18. A spring therein named Salsabeel.  
19. Passing among  them are eternalized 
youths. If you see them, you would think 
them sprinkled pearls.
