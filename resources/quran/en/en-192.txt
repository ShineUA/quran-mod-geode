## 45.  KNEELING   (al-Jathiyah)  
25. When Our clarifying Verses are recited to 
them, their only argument is to say, “Bring 
back our ancestors, if you are truthful.”  
26. Say, “Allah gives you life, then He makes 
you die; then He gathers you for the Day of 
Resurrection, about which there is no doubt. 
But most people do not know.”  
27. To Allah belongs the kingship of the heav-
ens and the earth. On the Day w hen the Hour 
takes place, on that Day the falsifiers will lose.  
28. You will see every community on its knees; 
every community will be called to its Book: “Today you are being repaid for what you 
used to do.  
29. This Book of Ours speaks about you in 
truth.  We have been transcribing what you 
have been doing.”  
30. As for those who believed and did right-
eous deeds, their Lord will admit them into 
His mercy. That is the clear triumph.  
31. But as for those who disbelieved: “Were My 
revelations not recited to you? But you 
turned arrogant, and were guilty people.”  
32. And when it was said, “The promise of Al-
lah is true, and of the Hour there is no doubt,” 
you said, “We do not know what the Hour is; we think it is only speculation; we are not 
convinced.”  
33. The evils of what they did will become evi-
dent to them, and the very thing they ridi-
culed will haunt them.  
34. And it will be said, “Today We forget you, 
as you forgot the encounter of this Day of 
yours. Your abode is the Fire, and there are 
no saviors for you . 
35. That is because you took Allah’s revela-
tions for a joke, and the worldly life lured 
you.” So today they will not be brought out of 
it, and they will not be allowed to repent.  
36. Praise belongs to Allah; Lord of the heav-
ens, Lord of the earth, Lord of humanity.  
37. To Him belongs all supremacy in the heav-
ens and the earth. He is the Majestic, the 
Wise.    
## 46. THE DUNES  (al-Ahqaf ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Ha, Meem.  
2. The sending down of the Scripture is from 
Allah, the Honorable, the Wise.  
3. We did not create the heavens and the earth 
and what lies between them except with rea-
son, and for a finite period. But the blas-
phemers continue to ignore the warnings 
they receive.  
4. Say, “Have you considered those you wor-
ship ins tead of Allah? Show me which por-
tion of the earth they have created. Or do they 
own a share of the heavens? Bring me a scrip-
ture prior to this one, or some trace of 
knowledge, if you are truthful.” 
5. Who is more wrong than him who invokes, 
besides Allah, those who will not answer him 
until the Day of Resurrection, and are heed-less of their prayers?  
6. And when humanity is gathered, they will 
be enemies to them, and will renounce their 
worship of them.  
7. When Our revelations are recited to them, 
plain and clear, those who disbelieve say of 
the truth when it has come to them, “This is 
obviously magic.”  
8. Or do they say, “He invented it himself”? 
Say, “If I invented it myself, there is nothing 
you can do to protect me from Allah. He 
knows well what you are e ngaged in. He is 
sufficient witness between me and you. He is 
the Forgiver, the Merciful.”  
9. Say, “I am not different from the other mes-
sengers; and I do not know what will be done 
with me, or with you. I only follow what is in-
spired in me, and I am only a clear warner.”  
10. Say, “Have you considered? What if it is 
from Allah and you disbelieve in it? A witness 
from the Children of Israel testified to its like,
