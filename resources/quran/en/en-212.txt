## 58.  THE ARGUMENT   (al-Mujadilah)  
has inscribed faith in their hearts, and has 
supported them with a spirit from Him. And 
He will admit them into Gardens beneath 
which rivers flow, wherein they will dwell 
forever. Allah is pleased with them, and they 
are pleased with Him. These are the partisans 
of Allah. Indeed, it is Allah’s partisans who 
are the successful.  
  
## 59. THE MOBILIZATION  (al-Hashr ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Glorifying Allah is all that exists in the heav-
ens and the  earth. He is the Almighty, the 
Most Wise.  
2. It is He who evicted those who disbelieved 
among the People of the Book from their 
homes at the first mobilization. You did not 
think they would leave, and they thought 
their fortresses would protect them from Al-
lah. But Allah came at them from where they 
never expected, and threw terror into their 
hearts. They wrecked their homes with their 
own hands, and by the hands of the believers. 
Therefore, take a lesson, O you who have in-
sight.  
3. Had Allah not decreed e xile for them, He 
would have punished them in this life. But in 
the Hereafter they will have the punishment 
of the Fire.  
4. That is because they opposed Allah and His 
Messenger. Whoever opposes Allah —Allah 
is stern in retribution.  
5. Whether you cut down a  tree, or leave it 
standing on its trunk, it is by Allah’s will. He 
will surely disgrace the sinners.  
6. Whatever Allah has bestowed upon His 
Messenger from them; you spurred neither 
horse nor camel for them, but Allah gives au-
thority to His messengers ove r whomever He 
will. Allah is Able to do all things.  
7. Whatever Allah restored to His Messenger 
from the inhabitants of the villages belongs to Allah, and to the Messenger, and to the rela-
tives, and to the orphans, and to the poor, and 
to the wayfarer; so that it may not circulate 
solely between the wealthy among you. 
Whatever the Messenger gives you, accept it; 
and whatever he forbids you, abstain from it. 
And fear Allah. Allah is severe in punish-
ment.  
8. To the poor refugees who were driven out 
of their h omes and their possessions, as they 
sought the favor of Allah and His approval, 
and came to the aid of Allah and His Messen-
ger. These are the sincere.  
9. And those who, before them, had settled in 
the homeland, and had accepted faith. They love those who e migrated to them, and find 
no hesitation in their hearts in helping them. 
They give them priority over themselves, 
even if they themselves are needy. Whoever 
is protected from his natural greed —it is they 
who are the successful.  
10. And those who came afte r them, saying, 
“Our Lord, forgive us, and our brethren who preceded us in faith, and leave no malice in 
our hearts towards those who believe. Our 
Lord, You are Clement and Merciful.”  
11. Have you not considered those who act 
hypocritically? They say to their brethren 
who disbelieved among the People of the Book, “If you are evicted, we will leave with 
you, and will not obey anyone against you; 
and should anyone fight you, we will cer-tainly support you.” But Allah bears witness 
that they are liars.  
12. If they are evicted, they will not leave with 
them; and if anyone fights them, they will not support them; and if they go to their aid, they 
will turn their backs and flee; then they will 
receive no support.  
13. Fear of you is more intense in their hearts 
than fear of Allah. That is because they are a 
people who do not understand.  
14. They will not fight you all together except 
from fortified strongholds, or from behind 
walls. Their hostility towards each other is se-
vere. You would think they are united, but
