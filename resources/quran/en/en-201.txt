## 51. THE SPREADERS  (adh-Dhariyat ) 
44. But they defied the command of their Lord, 
so the lightning struck them as they looked 
on. 
45. They could not rise up, nor could they find 
help.  
46. And before that, the people of Noah. They 
were immoral people.  
47. We constructed the universe with power, 
and We are expanding it.  
48. And the earth— We spread it out —How 
well We prepared it!  
49. We created all things in pairs, so that you 
may reflect and ponder.  
50. “So flee towards Al lah. I am to you from 
Him a clear warner.”  
51. “And do not set up any other god with Al-
lah. I am to you from Him a clear warner.”  
52. Likewise, no messenger came to those be-
fore them, but they said, “A sorcerer or a 
madman.”  
53. Did they recommend it to on e another? In 
fact, they are rebellious people.  
54. So turn away from them; you are not to 
blame.  
55. And remind, for the reminder benefits the 
believers.  
56. I did not create the jinn and the humans 
except to worship Me.  
57. I need no livelihood from them , nor do I 
need them to feed Me.  
58. Allah is the Provider, the One with Power, 
the Strong.  
59. Those who do wrong will have their turn, 
like the turn of their counterparts, so let them 
not rush Me.  
60. So woe to those who disbelieve because of 
that Day of  theirs which they are promised.  
  
## 52. THE MOUNT  (at-Tur) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  1. By the Mount.  
2. And a Book inscribed.  
3. In a published scroll.  
4. And the frequented House.  
5. And the elevated roof.  
6. And the seething sea.  
7. The punishment of your Lord is coming.  
8. There is nothing to avert it.  
9. On the Day when the heaven sways in agi-
tation.  
10. And the mountains go into motion.  
11. Woe on that Day to the deniers.  
12. Those who play with speculation.  
13. The Day when they are shoved into the Fire 
of Hell forcefully.  
14. “This is the Fire which you used to deny.  
15. Is this magic, or do you not see?  
16. Burn in it. Whether you are patient, or im-
patient, it is the same for you. You are only 
being repaid for what you used  to do.”  
17. But the righteous will be amid gardens and 
bliss.  
18. Enjoying what their Lord has given them, 
and their Lord has spared them the suffering of Hell.  
19. Eat and drink happily, for what you used to 
do. 
20. Relaxing on luxurious furnishings; and  We 
will couple them with gorgeous spouses.  
21. Those who believed, and their offspring 
followed them in faith— We will unite them 
with their offspring, and We will not deprive 
them of any of their works. Every person is 
hostage to what he has earned.  
22. And We will supply them with fruit, and 
meat; such as they desire.  
23. They will exchange therein a cup; wherein 
is neither harm, nor sin.  
24. Serving them will be youths like hidden 
pearls.
