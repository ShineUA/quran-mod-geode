## 8.  THE SPOILS   (al-Anfal)  
66. Allah has now lightened your burden, 
knowing that there is weakness in you. If 
there are a hundred steadfast among you, 
they will defeat two hundred; and if there are 
a thousand of you, they will defeat two thou-
sand by Allah’s lea ve. Allah is with the stead-
fast. 
67. It is not for a prophet to take prisoners be-
fore he has subdued the land. You desire the 
materials of this world, but Allah desires the 
Hereafter. Allah is Strong and Wise.  
68. Were it not for a predetermined decree 
from Allah, an awful punishment would have 
afflicted you for what you have taken.  
69. So consume what you have gained, legiti-
mate and wholesome; and remain conscious of Allah. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  
70. O prophet! Say to those you hold prisoners, 
“If Allah finds any good in your hearts, He 
will give you better than what was taken from 
you, and He will forgive you. Allah is Forgiv-
ing and Merciful.”  
71. But if they intend to betray you, they have 
already betrayed Allah, and He has overpow-
ered them. All ah is Knowing and Wise.  
72. Those who believed, and emigrated, and 
struggled in Allah’s cause with their posses-
sions and their persons, and those who pro-vided shelter and support —these are allies of 
one another. As for those who believed, but did not emigrate, you owe them no protec-tion, until they have emigrated. But if they 
ask you for help in religion, you must come 
to their aid, except against a people with 
whom you have a treaty. Allah is Seeing of 
what you do.  
73. As for those who disbelieve, they are allies 
of one another. Unless you do this, there will 
be turmoil in the land, and much corruption.  
74. Those who believed, and emigrated, and 
struggled for Allah’s cause, and those who gave shelter and support —these are the true 
believers. They will have forgiveness, and a 
bountiful provision.  75. As for those who believed afterwards, and 
emigrated and struggled with you —these be-
long with you. But family members are nearer to one another in the Book of Allah. 
Allah is Cognizant of everything.  
  
## 9. REPENTANCE  (at-Tawbah ) 
 
1. A declaration of immunity from Allah and 
His Messenger to the polytheists with whom 
you had made a treaty.  
2. So travel the land for four months, and 
know that you cannot escape Allah, and that 
Allah will disgrace the disbelievers.  
3. And a proclamation from Allah and His 
Messenger to the people on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage, that Allah has disowned 
the polytheists, and so did His Messenger. If 
you repent, it will be better for you. But if you 
turn away, know that you cann ot escape Al-
lah. And announce to those who disbelieve a painful punishment.  
4. Except for those among the polytheists with 
whom you had made a treaty, and did not vi-
olate any of its terms, nor aided anyone 
against you. So fulfill the treaty with them to 
the end of its term. Allah loves the righteous.  
5. When the Sacred Months have passed, kill 
the polytheists wherever you find them. And 
capture them, and besiege them, and lie in 
wait for them at every ambush. But if they re-
pent, and perform the prayers, and  pay the 
alms, then let them go their way. Allah is 
Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.  
6. And if anyone of the polytheists asks you for 
protection, give him protection so that he 
may hear the Word of Allah; then escort him 
to his place of safety. That is becau se they are 
a people who do not know.  
7. How can there be a treaty with the polythe-
ists on the part of Allah and His Messenger, except for those with whom you made a treaty at the Sacred Mosque? As long as they 
are upright with you, be upright with them. 
Allah loves the pious.
