## 32. PROSTRATION  (as-Sajdah )   
17. No soul knows what eye’s delight awaits 
them —a reward for what they used to do.  
18. Is someone who is faithful like someone 
who is a sinner? They are not equal.  
19. As for those who believe and do righteous 
deeds, for them are the Gardens of Shelter —
hospitality for what they used to do.  
20. But as for those who transgressed, their 
shelter is the Fire. Every time they try to get 
out of it, they will be broug ht back into it, and 
it will be said to them, “Taste the suffering of 
the Fire which you used to deny.”  
21. We will make them taste the lesser tor-
ment, prior to the greater torment, so that 
they may return.  
22. Who is more wrong than he, who, when 
reminded  of his Lord’s revelations, turns 
away from them? We will certainly wreak vengeance upon the criminals.  
23. We gave Moses the Book; so do not be in 
doubt regarding His encounter; and We made it a guidance for the Children of Israel.  
24. And We appointed le aders from among 
them, guiding by Our command, as long as 
they persevered and were certain of Our 
communications.  
25. Your Lord will judge between them on the 
Day of Resurrection regarding everything 
they had disputed.  
26. Is it not a lesson for them, how many gen-
erations We have destroyed before them, in whose habitations they walk? Surely in that 
are signs. Do they not hear?  
27. Do they not see how We conduct the water 
to a dry land, and with it We produce vegeta-
tion, from which their livestock eat, and 
themselves? Do they not see?  
28. And they say, “When is this victory, if you 
are truthful?”  
29. Say, “On the day of victory, the faith of 
those who disbelieved will be of no avail to 
them, and they will not be granted respite.”  
30. So turn away from them, a nd wait. They 
too are waiting.    
## 33. THE CONFEDERATES  (al-Ahzab ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. O Prophet! Fear Allah, and do not obey the 
unbelievers and the hypocrites. Allah is 
Knowledgeable and Wise.  
2. And follow what is revealed to you from 
your Lord. Allah is fully aware of what you do. 
3. And put your trust in Allah. Allah is enough 
as a trustee.  
4. Allah did not place two hearts inside any 
man's body. Nor did He make your wives 
whom you equate with your mothers, your actual mot hers. Nor did He make your 
adopted sons, your actual sons. These are your words coming out of your mouths. Al-
lah speaks the truth, and guides to the path.  
5. Call them after their fathers; that is more 
equitable with Allah. But if you do not know 
their fathers, then your brethren in faith and 
your friends. There is no blame on you if you 
err therein, barring what your hearts pre-
meditates. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  
6. The Prophet is more caring of the believers 
than they are of themselves, and his wives are 
mothers to them. And blood -relatives are 
closer to one another in Allah’s Book than the 
believers or the emigrants, though you 
should do good to your friends. That is in-
scribed in the Book.  
7. Recall that We received a pledge from the 
prophets, a nd from you, and from Noah, and 
Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus son of Mary. We received from them a solemn pledge.  
8. That He may ask the sincere about their sin-
cerity. He has prepared for the disbelievers a 
painful punishment.  
9. O you who believe! Remember Allah’s 
blessings upon you, when forces came against you, and We sent against them a wind, and
