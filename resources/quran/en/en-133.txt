## 24.  THE LIGHT   (an-Nur)   
those before them successors, and He will es-
tablish for them their religion —which He has 
approved for them —and He will substitute 
security in place of their fear. They worship Me, never associating  anything with Me. But 
whoever disbelieves after that —these are the 
sinners.  
56. Pray regularly, and give regular charity, 
and obey the Messenger, so that you may re-ceive mercy.  
57. Never think that those who disbelieve can 
escape on earth. Their place is the Fire; a mis-
erable destination.  
58. O you who believe! Permission must be re-
quested by your servants and those of you 
who have not reached puberty. On three oc-casions: before the Dawn Prayer, and at noon 
when you change your clothes, and after the 
Eveni ng Prayer. These are three occasions of 
privacy for you. At other times, it is not 
wrong for you or them to intermingle with 
one another. Allah thus clarifies the revela-
tions for you. Allah is Knowledgeable and 
Wise.  
59. When the children among you reach p u-
berty, they must ask permission, as those be-
fore them asked permission. Allah thus clari-
fies His revelations for you. Allah is Knowl-
edgeable and Wise.  
60. Women past the age of childbearing, who 
have no desire for marriage, commit no 
wrong by taking off t heir outer clothing, pro-
vided they do not flaunt their finery. But to 
maintain modesty is better for them. Allah is 
Hearing and Knowing.  
61. There is no blame on the blind, nor any 
blame on the lame, nor any blame on the sick, 
nor on yourselves for eating at your homes, 
or your fathers’ homes, or your mothers’ homes, or your brothers’ homes, or your sis-
ters’ homes, or the homes of your paternal 
uncles, or the homes of your paternal aunts, 
or the homes of your maternal uncles, or the homes of your maternal a unts, or those 
whose keys you own, or the homes of your friends. You commit no wrong by eating to-
gether or separately. But when you enter any home, greet one another with a greeting from 
Allah, blessed and good. Allah thus explains 
the revelations for you,  so that you may un-
derstand.  
62. The believers are those who believe in Al-
lah and His Messenger, and when they are 
with him for a matter of common interest, 
they do not leave until they have asked him 
for permission. Those who ask your permis-
sion are those  who believe in Allah and His 
Messenger. So when they ask your permis-
sion to attend to some affair of theirs, give 
permission to any of them you wish, and ask 
Allah’s forgiveness for them. Allah is Forgiv-
ing and Merciful.  
63. Do not address the Messenger i n the same 
manner you address one another. Allah 
knows those of you who slip away using flimsy excuses. So let those who oppose his 
orders beware, lest an ordeal strikes them, or 
a painful punishment befalls them.  
64. Surely, to Allah belongs everything in  the 
heavens and the earth. He knows what you 
are about. And on the Day they are returned 
to Him, He will inform them of what they 
did. Allah has full knowledge of all things.  
  
## 25. THE CRITERION  
(al-Furqan)  
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Blessed is He who sent down the Criterion 
upon His servant, to be a warning to human-
ity. 
2. He to whom belongs the kingdom of the 
heavens and the earth, who took to Himself no son, who never had a partner in His king-
ship; who created everything and det ermined 
its measure.  
3. And yet, instead of Him, they produce for 
themselves gods that create nothing, but are 
themselves created; that have no power to 
harm or benefit themselves; and no power 
over life, death, or resurrection.
