## 9.  REPENTANCE   (at-Tawbah)  
closed in on them, and their very souls closed 
in on them, and they realized that there was 
no refuge from Allah, except in Him, He re-
deemed them, so that they may repent. Allah 
is the Redeemer, the Merciful.  
119. O you who believe! Be conscious of Allah, 
and be with the sincere.  
120. It is not for the inhab itants of Medina and 
the Desert -Arabs around them to stay behind 
the Messenger of Allah, nor to prefer them-
selves to him. That is because they never suf-
fer any thirst, nor fatigue, nor hunger in the 
cause of Allah, nor do they take one step that 
enrages th e disbelievers, nor do they gain an-
ything from an enemy, but it is recorded to 
their credit as a righteous deed. Allah does 
not waste the reward of the righteous.  
121. Nor do they spend any expenditure, small 
or large, nor do they cross any valley, but it is recorded to their credit. That Allah may re-
ward them in accordance with the best of 
their deeds.  
122. It is not advisable for the believers to 
march out altogether. Of every division that 
marches out, let a group remain behind, to 
gain understanding of the religion, and to no-
tify their people when they have returned to 
them, that they may beware.  
123. O you who believe! Fight those of the dis-
believers who attack you, and let them find 
severity in you, and know that Allah is with 
the righteous.  
124. Whenever a chapter is revealed, some of 
them say, “Which of you has this increased in 
faith?” As for those who believe: it increases 
them in faith, and they rejoice.  
125. But as for those in whose hearts is sick-
ness: it adds disgrace to their disgrace, and 
they  die as unbelievers.  
126. Do they not see that they are tested once 
or twice every year? Yet they do not repent, 
and they do not learn.  
127. And whenever a chapter is revealed, they 
look at one another, “Does anyone see you?” 
Then they slip away. Allah ha s diverted their hearts, because they are a people who do not 
understand.  
128. There has come to you a messenger from 
among yourselves, concerned over your suf-
fering, anxious over you. Towards the believ-
ers, he is compassionate and merciful.  
129. If they turn away, say, “Allah is enough for 
me; there is no god except He; in Him I have 
put my trust; He is the Lord of the Sublime 
Throne.”  
  
## 10. JONAH  (Yunus ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Alif, Lam, Ra. These are the Verses of the 
Wise Book.  
2. Is it a wonder to the people that We inspired 
a man from among them: “Warn mankind, 
and give good news to those who believe that they are on a sound footing with their Lord”? 
The disbelievers said, “This is a manifest sor-
cerer.”  
3. Your Lord is Al lah, who created the heavens 
and the earth in six days, then settled over the 
Throne, governing all things. There is no in-
tercessor except after His permission. Such is 
Allah, your Lord —so serve Him. Will you not 
reflect?  
4. To Him is your return, altogeth er. The 
promise of Allah is true. He originates crea-tion, and then He repeats it, to reward those 
who believe and do good deeds with equity. 
As for those who disbelieve, for them is a 
drink of boiling water, and agonizing tor-ment, on account of their disbe lief. 
5. It is He who made the sun radiant, and the 
moon a light, and determined phases for it —
that you may know the number of years and 
the calculation. Allah did not create all this 
except with truth. He details the revelations 
for a people who know.
