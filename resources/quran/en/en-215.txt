## 61. COLUMN  (as-Saff)  
14. O you who believe! Be supporters of All ah, 
as Jesus son of Mary said to the disciples, 
“Who are my supporters towards Allah?” 
The disciples said, “We are Allah's support-
ers.” So a group of the Children of Israel be-
lieved, while another group disbelieved. We 
supported those who believed against their 
foe, so they became dominant.  
  
## 62. FRIDAY (al-Jumu’ah ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Everything in the heavens and the earth glo-
rifies Allah the Sovereign, the Holy, the Al-
mighty, the Wise.  
2. It is He who sent among the unlett ered a 
messenger from themselves; reciting His rev-elations to them, and purifying them, and 
teaching them the Scripture and wisdom; alt-
hough they were in obvious error before that.  
3. And others from them, who have not yet 
joined them. He is the Glorious, the Wise.  
4. That is Allah’s grace, which He grants to 
whomever He wills. Allah is Possessor of lim-
itless grace.  
5. The example of those who were entrusted 
with the Torah, but then failed to uphold it, 
is like the donkey carrying works of litera-
ture. Miser able is the example of the people 
who denounce Allah’s revelations. Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.  
6. Say, “O you who follow Judaism; if you 
claim to be the chosen of Allah, to the exclu-
sion of the rest of mankind, then wish for 
death if you a re sincere.”  
7. But they will not wish for it, ever, due to 
what their hands have advanced. Allah knows 
well the wrongdoers.  
8. Say, “The death from which you flee will 
catch up with you; then you will be returned 
to the Knower of the Invisible and the Vis ible, 
and He will inform you of what you used to 
do.” 9. O you who believe! When the call is made 
for prayer on Congregation Day, hasten to 
the remembrance of Allah, and drop all busi-
ness. That is better for you, if you only knew.  
10. Then, when the prayer is concluded, dis-
perse through the land, and seek Allah’s 
bounty, and remember Allah much, so that 
you may prosper.  
11. Yet whenever they come across some busi-
ness, or some entertainment, they scramble 
towards it, and leave you standi ng. Say, 
“What is with Allah is better than entertain-
ment and business; and Allah is the Best of 
providers.”  
  
## 63. THE HYPOCRITES  (al-Munafiqun)  
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. When the hypocrites come to you, they say, 
“We bear witness  that you are Allah’s Mes-
senger.” Allah knows that you are His Mes-senger, and Allah bears witness that the hyp-
ocrites are liars.  
2. They treat their oaths as a cover, and so they 
repel others from Allah’s path. Evil is what 
they do.  
3. That is because they  believed, and then dis-
believed; so their hearts were sealed, and they 
cannot understand.  
4. When you see them, their appearance im-
presses you. And when they speak, you listen 
to what they say. They are like propped -up 
timber. They think every shout is aim ed at 
them. They are the enemy, so beware of them. 
Allah condemns them; how deluded they are!  
5. And when it is said to them, “Come, the 
Messenger of Allah will ask forgiveness for 
you,” they bend their heads, and you see them 
turning away arrogantly.  
6. It is the same for them, whether you ask for-
giveness for them, or do not ask forgiveness 
for them; Allah will not forgive them. Allah 
does not guide the sinful people.
