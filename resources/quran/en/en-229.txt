## 77. THE UNLEASHED  (al-Mursalat )  
39. So if you have a strategy, use it against Me.  
40. Woe on that Day to the falsifiers.  
41. The righteous will be amidst shades and 
fountains.  
42. And fruits as they desire.  
43. “Eat and drink pleasantly, for what you 
used to do.”  
44. This is how We reward the doers of good.  
45. Woe on that Day to the deniers.  
46. “Eat and enjoy yourselves a little; you are 
indeed criminals.”  
47. Woe on that Day to the liars.  
48. And when it is said to them, “Kneel”, they 
do not kneel.  
49. Woe on that Day to the rejecters.  
50. In what message, beyond this, will they be-
lieve?  
  
## 78. THE EVENT  (an-Naba’ ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. What are they asking one another about?  
2. About the Great Event.  
3. About which they disagree.  
4. Surely, they will find out.  
5. Most certainly, they will find out.  
6. Did We not make the earth a cradle?  
7. And the mountains pegs?  
8. And created you in pairs?  
9. And made your sleep for rest?  
10. And made the night a cover?  
11. And made the day for livelihood?  
12. And built above you seven strong ones?  
13. And placed a blazing lamp?  
14. And brought down from the clouds pour-
ing water?  
15. To produce with it grains and vegetation?  16. And luxuriant gardens?  
17. The Day of Sorting has been appointed.  
18. The Day when the Trumpet is blown, and 
you will come in droves.  
19. And the sky is opened up, and becomes 
gateways.  
20. And the mountains are set in motion, and 
become a mirage.  
21. Hell is lying in ambush.  
22. For the oppressors, a destination.  
23. Where they will remain for eons.  
24. They will taste therein neither coolnes s, 
nor drink.  
25. Except boiling water, and freezing hail.  
26. A fitting requital.  
27. For they were not anticipating any reckon-
ing. 
28. And they denied Our signs utterly.  
29. But We have enumerated everything in 
writing.  
30. So taste! We will increase you  only in suf-
fering.  
31. But for the righteous there is triumph.  
32. Gardens and vineyards.  
33. And splendid spouses, well matched.  
34. And delicious drinks.  
35. They will hear therein neither gossip, nor 
lies. 
36. A reward from your Lord, a fitting gift.  
37. Lord of the heavens and the earth, and eve-
rything between them —The Most Merci-
ful—none can argue with Him.  
38. On the Day when the Spirit and the angels 
stand in row. They will not speak, unless it be 
one permitted by the Most Merciful, and he 
will say w hat is right.  
39. That is the Day of Reality. So whoever wills, 
let him take a way back to his Lord.  
40.  We have warned you of a near punish-
ment —the Day when a person will observe
