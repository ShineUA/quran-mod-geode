15. And mentions the name of his Lord, and 
prays.  
16. But you prefer the present life.  
17. Though the Hereafter is better, and more 
lasting.  
18. This is in the former scrip tures.  
19. The Scriptures of Abraham and Moses.  
  
## 88. THE OVERWHELMING  (al-Ghashiyah ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Has there come to you the news of the over-
whelming?  
2. Faces on that Day will be shamed.  
3. Laboring and exhausted.  
4. Roasting in a scorching Fire.  
5. Given to drink from a flaming spring.  
6. They will have no food except thorns.  
7. That neither nourishes, nor satisfies hun-
ger. 
8. Faces on that Day will be joyful.  
9. Satisfied with their endeavor.  
10. In a lofty Garden.  
11. In it you will hear no nonsense.  
12. In it is a flowing spring.  
13. In it are raised beds.  
14. And cups set in place.  
15. And cushions set in rows.  
16. And carpets spread around.  
17. Do they not look at the camels —how they 
are created?  
18. And at the  sky—how it is raised?  
19. And at the mountains —how they are in-
stalled?  
20. And at the earth —how it is spread out?  
21. So remind. You are only a reminder.  
22. You have no control over them.  23. But whoever turns away and disbelieves.  
24. Allah will punish him with the greatest 
punishment.  
25. To Us is their return.  
26. Then upon Us rests their reckoning.  
  
## 89. THE DAWN (al-Fajr) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. By the daybreak.  
2. And ten nights.  
3. And the even and the odd.  
4. And the ni ght as it recedes.  
5. Is there in this an oath for a rational person?  
6. Have you not seen how your Lord dealt 
with Aad?  
7. Erum of the pillars.  
8. The like of which was never created in the 
land.  
9. And Thamood —those who carved the 
rocks in the valley.  
10. And Pharaoh of the Stakes.  
11. Those who committed excesses in the 
lands.  
12. And spread much corruption therein.  
13. So your Lord poured down upon them a 
scourge of punishment.  
14. Your Lord is on the lookout.  
15. As for man, whenever his Lord tests him , 
and honors him, and prospers him, he says, 
“My Lord has honored me.”  
16. But whenever He tests him, and restricts 
his livelihood for him, he says, “My Lord has insulted me.”  
17. Not at all. But you do not honor the or-
phan.  
18. And you do not urge the fee ding of the 
poor.
