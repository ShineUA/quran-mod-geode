## 50.  QAF   (Qaf) )  
45. We are fully aware of what they say, and 
you are not a dictator over them. So remind 
by the Quran whoever fears My warning.  
  
## 51. THE SPREADERS  (adh-Dhariyat ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. By the spreaders spreading.  
2. And those carrying loads.  
3. And those moving gently.  
4. And those distributing as commanded.  
5. What you are promised is true.  
6. Judgment will take place.  
7. By the sky that is woven.  
8. You differ in what you say.  
9. Averted from  it is he who is averted.  
10. Perish the imposters.  
11. Those who are dazed in ignorance.  
12. They ask, “When is the Day of Judgment?”  
13. The Day they are presented to the Fire.  
14. “Taste your ordeal. This is what you used 
to challenge.”  
15. But the piou s are amidst gardens and 
springs.  
16. Receiving what their Lord has given them. 
They were virtuous before that.  
17. They used to sleep a little at night.  
18. And at dawn, they would pray for pardon.  
19. And in their wealth, there was a share for 
the beggar  and the deprived.  
20. And on earth are signs for the convinced.  
21. And within yourselves. Do you not see?  
22. And in the heaven is your livelihood, and 
what you are promised.  
23. By the Lord of the heaven and the earth, it 
is as true as the fact that you  speak.  24. Has the story of Abraham’s honorable 
guests reached you?  
25. When they entered upon him, they said, 
“Peace.” He said, “Peace, strangers.”  
26. Then he slipped away to his family, and 
brought a fatted calf.  
27. He set it before them. He said, “Will you 
not eat?”  
28. And he harbored fear of them. They said, 
“Do not fear,” and they announced to him the 
good news of a knowledgeable boy.  
29. His wife came forward crying. She clasped 
her face, and said, “A barren old woman?”  
30. They said, “Thus spoke your Lord. He is 
the Wise, the Knowing.”  
31. He said, “What is your business, O en-
voys?”  
32. They said, “We are sent to a people guilty 
of sin.”  
33. “To unleash upon them rocks of clay.”  
34. “Marked by your Lord for the excessive.”  
35. We evacuated all the  believers who were in 
it. 
36. But found in it only one household of Mus-
lims.  
37. And We left in it a sign for those who fear 
the painful punishment.  
38. And in Moses. We sent him to Pharaoh 
with a clear authority.  
39. But he turned away with his warlords,  and 
said, “A sorcerer or a madman.”  
40. So We seized him and his troops, and 
threw them into the sea, and He was to 
blame.  
41. And in Aad. We unleashed against them 
the devastating wind.  
42. It spared nothing it came upon, but ren-
dered it like decayed ruins.  
43. And in Thamood. They were told, “Enjoy 
yourselves for a while.”
