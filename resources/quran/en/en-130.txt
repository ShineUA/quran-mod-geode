## 23.  THE BELIEVERS   (al-Mu’minun)  
112. He will say, “How many y ears did you re-
main on earth?”  
113. They will say, “We remained a day, or part 
of a day; but ask those who keep count.”  
114. He will say, “You remained only for a little 
while, if you only knew.  
115. Did you think that We created you in vain, 
and that to Us you will not be returned?”  
116. So Exalted is Allah, the Ruler, the Real. 
There is no god except He, the Lord of the 
Noble Throne.  
117. Whoever invokes another god besides Al-
lah—he has no proof thereof —his reckoning 
rests with his Lord. The disbelievers  will not 
succeed.  
118. And say, “My Lord, forgive and have 
mercy, for You are the Best of the merciful.”  
  
## 24. THE LIGHT  (an-Nur)  
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. A chapter that We have revealed, and made 
obligatory, and revealed in it clear Verses, 
that you may take heed.  
2. The adulteress and the adulterer —whip 
each one of them a hundred lashes, and let no pity towards them overcome you regarding 
Allah’s Law, if you believe in Allah and the 
Last Day. And let a group of believers witnes s 
their punishment.  
3. The adulterer shall marry none but an adul-
teress or an idolatress; and the adulteress 
shall marry none but an adulterer or an idol-ater. That has been prohibited for the believ-
ers. 
4. Those who accuse chaste women, then can-
not bring f our witnesses, whip them eighty 
lashes, and do not ever accept their testi-
mony. For these are the immoral.  
5. Except for those who repent afterwards, and 
reform; for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  6. As for those who accuse their own spouses, 
but have no  witnesses except themselves, the 
testimony of one of them is equivalent to four testimonies, if he swears by Allah that he is 
truthful.  
7. And the fifth time, that Allah’s curse be 
upon him, if he is a liar.  
8. But punishment shall be averted from her, 
if she swears four times by Allah, that he is a 
liar. 
9. And the fifth time, that Allah’s wrath be 
upon her, if he is truthful.  
10. Were it not for Allah’s grace upon you, and 
His mercy, and that Allah is Conciliatory and 
Wise.  
11. Those who perpetrated the slander are a 
band of you. Do not consider it bad for you, 
but it is good for you. Each person among them bears his share in the sin. As for him 
who played the major role —for him is a ter-
rible punishment.  
12. Why, when you heard about it, the believ-
ing men  and women did not think well of one 
another, and say, “This is an obvious lie”?  
13. Why did they not bring four witnesses to 
testify to it? If they fail to bring the witnesses, 
then in Allah’s sight, they are liars.  
14. Were it not for Allah’s favor upon you, and 
His mercy, in this world and the Hereafter, 
you would have suffered a great punishment 
for what you have ventured into.  
15. When you rumored it with your tongues, 
and spoke with your mouths what you had no 
knowledge of, and you considered it trivi al; 
but according to Allah, it is serious.  
16. When you heard it, you should have said, 
“It is not for us to repeat this. By Your glory, 
this is a serious slander.”  
17. Allah cautions you never to return to the 
like of it, if you are believers.  
18. Allah explains the Verses to you. Allah is 
Knowing and Wise.  
19. Those who love to see immorality spread 
among the believers —for them is a painful
