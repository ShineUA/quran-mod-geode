## 20.  TA-HA  (Ta-Ha)  
whose settlements they walk? Surel y in that 
are signs for people of understanding.  
129. Were it not for a word that issued from 
your Lord, the inevitable would have hap-
pened, but there is an appointed term.  
130. So bear patiently what they say, and cele-
brate the praises of your Lord before  the ris-
ing of the sun, and before its setting. And 
during the hours of the night glorify Him, 
and at the borders of the day, that you may be 
satisfied.  
131. And do not extend your glance towards 
what We have given some classes of them to enjoy —the splendo r of the life of this world —
that We may test them thereby. Your Lord’s 
provision is better, and more lasting.  
132. And exhort your people to pray, and pa-
tiently adhere to it. We ask of you no suste-
nance, but it is We who sustain you. The good 
ending is tha t for righteousness.  
133. And they say, “Why does he not bring us 
a miracle from his Lord?” Were they not 
given enough miracles in the former scrip-
tures?  
134. Had We destroyed them with a punish-
ment before him, they would have said, “Our 
Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger, we 
would have followed Your revelations before 
we were humiliated and disgraced.”  
135. Say, “Everybody is waiting, so wait. You 
will know who the people of the straight path are, and who is rightly -guided.  
  
## 21. THE PROPHETS  (al-Anbiya) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Mankind’s reckoning has drawn near, but 
they turn away heedlessly.  
2. No fresh reminder comes to them from 
their Lord, but they listen to it playfully.  
3. Their hearts distracted, the wrongdoers 
confer secretly, “Is this anything but a mortal like you? Will you take to sorcery, with open -
eyes?”  
4. He said, “My Lord knows what is said in the 
heaven and the earth; and He is the Hearer, the Knower.”  
5. And they said, “A jumble of dreams,” and, 
“He ma de it up,” and, “He is a poet,” “let him 
bring us a sign, like those sent to the an-cients.”  
6. None of the towns We destroyed before 
them had believed. Will they, then, believe?  
7. We did not send before you except men, 
whom We inspired. Ask the people of knowledge, if you do not know.  
8. We did not make them mere bodies that ate 
no food, nor were they immortal.  
9. Then We fulfilled Our promise to them, 
and We saved them together with whomever 
We willed, and We destroyed the extrava-
gant.  
10. We have sent d own to you a Book, contain-
ing your message. Do you not understand?  
11. How many a guilty town have We crushed, 
and established thereafter another people?  
12. Then, when they sensed Our might, they 
started running away from it.  
13. Do not run, but come back  to your luxu-
ries, and to your homes, that you may be 
questioned.  
14. They said, “Woe to us; we were unfair.”  
15. This continued to be their cry, until We 
made them silent ashes.  
16. We did not create the sky and the earth and 
what is between them for amus ement.  
17. If We wanted amusement, We could have 
found it within Us, were We to do so.  
18. In fact, We hurl the truth against falsehood, 
and it crushes it, so it vanishes. Woe unto 
you, for what you describe.  
19. To Him belongs everyone in the heavens 
and the earth. Those near Him are not too 
proud to worship Him, nor do they waver.
