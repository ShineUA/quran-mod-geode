## 26.  THE POETS   (ash-Shu’ara’)  
51. We are eager for our Lord to forgive us our 
sins, sinc e we are the first of the believers.”  
52. And We inspired Moses: “Travel with My 
servants by night. You will be followed.”  
53. Pharaoh sent heralds to the cities.  
54. “These are a small gang.  
55. And they are enraging us.  
56. But we are a vigilant multitud e.” 
57. So We drove them out of gardens and 
springs.  
58. And treasures and noble dwellings.  
59. So it was. And We made the Children of 
Israel inherit them.  
60. And they pursued them at sunrise.  
61. When the two groups sighted each other, 
the followers of Moses said, “We are being 
overtaken.”  
62. He said, “No; my Lord is with me, He will 
guide me.”  
63. We inspired Moses: “Strike the sea with 
your staff.” Whereupon it parted, and each 
part was like a huge hill.  
64. And there We brought the others near.  
65. And We saved Moses and those with him, 
all together.  
66. Then We drowned the others.  
67. In that there is a sign, but most of them are 
not believers.  
68. Surely, your Lord is the Almighty, the Mer-
ciful.  
69. And relate to them the story of Abraham.  
70. When he said to his father and his people, 
“What do you worship?”  
71. They said, “We worship idols, and we re-
main devoted to them.”  
72. He said, “Do they hear you when you pray?  
73. Or do they benefit you, or harm you?”  
74. They said, “But we found our ancestor s do-
ing so.”  75. He said, “Have you considered what you 
worship.  
76. You and your ancient ancestors?  
77. They are enemies to me, but not so the 
Lord of the Worlds.  
78. He who created me, and guides me.  
79. He who feeds me, and waters me.  
80. And when I get sick, He heals me.  
81. He who makes me die, and then revives me.  
82. He who, I hope, will forgive my sins on the 
Day of the Reckoning.”  
83. “My Lord! Grant me wisdom, and include 
me with the righteous.  
84. And give me a reputation of truth among 
the ot hers.  
85. And make me of the inheritors of the Gar-
den of Bliss.  
86. And forgive my father —he was one of the 
misguided.  
87. And do not disgrace me on the Day they 
are resurrected.  
88. The Day when neither wealth nor children 
will help.  
89. Except for him who comes to Allah with a 
sound heart.”  
90. And Paradise will be brought near for the 
righteous.  
91. And the Blaze will be displayed to the devi-
ators.  
92. And it will be said to them, “Where are 
those you used to worship?”  
93. Besides Allah? Can they help you, or help 
themselves?”  
94. Then they will be toppled into it, together 
with the seducers.  
95. And the soldiers of Satan, all of them.  
96. They will say, as they feud in it.  
97. “By Allah, We were in evident error.  
98. For equating you with the Lord of the 
Worlds.
