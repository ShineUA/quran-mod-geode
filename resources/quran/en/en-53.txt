## 6.  LIVESTOCK   (al-An’am)  
earned goodness through its faith. Say, “Wait, 
we too are waiting.”  
159. As for those who divided their religion 
and became sects —you have nothing to do 
with them. Their case rests with Allah; then 
He will inform them of what they used to do.  
160. Whoever comes up with a good deed will 
have ten times its like; and whoever comes up 
with an evil deed will be repaid only with its 
equivalent —they will not be wronged.  
161. Say, “My Lord has guided me to a straight 
path, an upright religion, the creed of Ab ra-
ham the Monotheist, who was not a polythe-ist.” 
162. Say, “My prayer and my worship, and my 
life and my death, are devoted to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.  
163. No associate has He. Thus I am com-
manded, and I am the first of those who sub-
mit. 
164. Say, “Am I to seek a Lord other than Allah, 
when He is the Lord of all things?” No soul gets except what it is due, and no soul bears 
the burdens of another. Then to your Lord is 
your return, then He will inform you regard-
ing your disputes.  
165. It is He who ma de you successors on the 
earth, and raised some of you in ranks over 
others, in order to test you through what He has given you. Your Lord is Quick in retribu-tion, and He is Forgiving and Merciful.  
  
## 7. THE ELEVATIONS  (al-A’raf ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the G racious, the Merciful  
1. Alif, Lam, Meem, Saad.  
2. A Scripture was revealed to you, so let there 
be no anxiety in your heart because of it. You are to warn with it —and a reminder for the 
believers.  
3. Follow what is revealed to you from your 
Lord, and do n ot follow other masters beside 
Him. Little you recollect.  4. How many a town have We destroyed? Our 
might came upon them by night, or while they were napping.  
5. When Our might came upon them, their 
only cry was, “We were indeed wrongdoers.”  
6. We will que stion those to whom messen-
gers were sent, and We will question the mes-
sengers.  
7. We will narrate to them with knowledge, 
for We were never absent.  
8. The scales on that Day will be just. Those 
whose weights are heavy —it is they who are 
the successful.  
9. But as for those whose weights are light— it 
is they who have lost their souls, because they 
used to mistreat Our revelations.  
10. We have established you firmly on earth, 
and made for you in it livelihood —but rarely 
do you give thanks.  
11. We created you, then We shaped you, then 
We said to the angels, “Bow down before 
Adam;” so they bowed down, except for Sa-tan; he was not of those who bowed down.  
12. He said, “What prevented you from bow-
ing down when I have commanded you?” He 
said, “I am better than he; Y ou created me 
from fire, and You created him from mud.”  
13. He said, “Get down from it! It is not for you 
to act arrogantly in it. Get out! You are one of 
the lowly!”  
14. He said, “Give me respite, until the Day 
they are resurrected.”  
15. He said, “You are  of those given respite.”  
16. He said, “Because you have lured me, I will 
waylay them on Your straight path.  
17. Then I will come at them from before 
them, and from behind them, and from their 
right, and from their left; and you will not 
find most of them appreciative.”  
18. He said, “Get out of it, despised and van-
quished. Whoever among them follows you—I will fill up Hell with you all.
