## 59. THE MOBILIZATION  (al-Hashr ) 
their hearts are diverse. That is because they 
are a people who do not understand.  
15. Like those shortly before them. They expe-
rienced the consequences of their decisions. 
For them is a painful punishment.  
16. Like the devil, when he says to the human 
being, “Disbelieve.” But when he has disbe-
lieved, he says, “I am innocent of you; I fear 
Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.”  
17. The ultimate end for both of them is the 
Fire, where they will dwell forever. Such is the 
requital for the wrongdoers.  
18. O you who believe! Fear Allah, and let 
every soul consider what it has forwarded for the morrow, and fear Allah. Allah is Aware of 
what you do.  
19. And do not be like those who forgot Allah, 
so He made them forget themselves. These 
are the sinners.  
20. Not equal are the inhabitants of the Fire 
and the inhabitants of Paradise. It is the in-habitants of Paradise who are the winners.  
21. Had We sent this Quran down on a moun-
tain, you would have seen it trembling, crum-
bling in awe of Allah. These parables We cite 
for the people, so that they may reflect.  
22. He is Allah. There is no god but He, the 
Knower of secrets and declarations. He is  the 
Compassionate, the Merciful.  
23. He is Allah; besides Whom there is no god; 
the Sovereign, the Holy, the Peace -Giver, the 
Faith -Giver, the Overseer, the Almighty, the 
Omnipotent, the Overwhelming. Glory be to 
Allah, beyond what they associate.  
24. He is Allah; the Creator, the Maker, the De-
signer. His are the Most Beautiful Names. 
Whatever is in the heavens and the earth glo-
rifies Him. He is the Majestic, the Wise.  
  
## 60. THE WOMAN TESTED  (al-Mumtahina ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  1. O you who believe! Do not take My enemies 
and your enemies for supporters, offering 
them affection, when they have disbelieved in 
what has come to you of the Truth. They have 
expelled the Messenger, and you, because you 
believed in Allah, your Lord. If y ou have mo-
bilized to strive for My cause, seeking My ap-
proval, how can you secretly love them? I 
know what you conceal and what you reveal. 
Whoever among you does that has strayed 
from the right way.  
2. Whenever they encounter you, they treat 
you as enemie s, and they stretch their hands 
and tongues against you with malice. They wish that you would disbelieve.  
3. Neither your relatives nor your children 
will benefit you on the Day of Resurrection. 
He will separate between you. Allah is Ob-servant of what you do.  
4. You have had an excellent example in Abra-
ham and those with him; when they said to 
their people, “We are quit of you, and what you worship apart from Allah. We denounce 
you. Enmity and hatred has surfaced between 
us and you, forever, until you belie ve in Allah 
alone.” Except for the words of Abraham to 
his father, “I will ask forgiveness for you, 
though I have no power from Allah to do an-
ything for you.” “Our Lord, in You we trust, 
and to You we repent, and to You is the ulti-
mate resort.  
5. Our Lord,  do not make us a target for those 
who disbelieve, and forgive us, our Lord. You 
are indeed the Mighty and Wise.”  
6. There is an excellent example in them for 
you—for anyone who seeks Allah and the 
Last Day. But whoever turns away —Allah is 
the Self -Suffici ent, the Most Praised.  
7. Perhaps Allah will plant affection between 
you and those of them you consider enemies. Allah is Capable. Allah is Forgiving and Mer-
ciful.  
8. As for those who have not fought against 
you for your religion, nor expelled you from 
your homes, Allah does not prohibit you 
from dealing with them kindly and equitably. 
Allah loves the equitable.
