## 29.  THE SPIDER   (al-’Ankabut)  
and the moon?” They would say, “Allah.” 
Why then do they deviate?  
62. Allah expands the provision for whomever 
He wills of His servants, and restricts it. Allah 
is Cognizant of all things.  
63. And if you asked them, “Who sends water 
down from the sky, with which He revives the 
earth after it had died?” They would say, “Al-
lah.” Say, “Praise be to Allah.” But most of 
them do not understand.  
64. The life of this world is nothing but diver-
sion and play, and the Home of the Hereafter 
is the Life, if they only knew.  
65. When they embark on a vessel, they pray 
to Allah, devoting their faith to Him; but 
once He has delivered them safely to land, 
they attribute partners to Him.  
66. To be ungrateful for what We have given 
them, and to enjoy themselves. They will 
surely come to know.  
67. Do they not see that We established a Se-
cure Sa nctuary, while all around them the 
people are being carried away? Do they be-
lieve in falsehood, and reject the blessings of 
Allah?  
68. And who does greater wrong than he who 
fabricates lies and attributes them to Allah, or 
calls the truth a lie when it has  come to him? 
Is there not in Hell a dwelling for the blas-phemers?  
69. As for those who strive for Us —We will 
guide them in Our ways. Allah is with the do-ers of good.  
  
## 30. THE ROMANS  (ar-Rum ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Alif, Lam, Meem.  
2. The Romans have been defeated.  
3. In a nearby territory. But following their de-
feat, they will be victorious.  4. In a few years. The matter is up to Allah, in 
the past, and in the future. On that day, the 
believers will rejoice.  
5. In Allah’s support. He supports whomever 
He wills. He is the Almighty, the Merciful.  
6. The promise of Allah— Allah never breaks 
His promise, but most people do not know.  
7. They know an outer aspect of the worldly 
life, but they are heedless of the Hereafter.  
8. Do they not reflect within themselves? Al-
lah did not create the heavens and the earth, 
and what is between them, except with rea-
son, and for a specific duration. But most 
people, regarding meeting their Lord, are dis-
believers.  
9. Have they not travelled the earth and seen 
how those before them ended up? They were 
more powerful than them, and they culti-vated the land and developed it more than 
they developed it, and their messengers came 
to them with clear signs. Allah would never 
wrong them, but they used to w rong them-
selves.  
10. Then, evil was the end of those who com-
mitted evil. That is because they rejected Al-
lah’s revelations, and used to ridicule them.  
11. Allah originates creation, and then repeats 
it. Then to Him you will be returned.  
12. On the Day when  the Hour takes place, the 
guilty will despair.  
13. They will have no intercessors from among 
their idols, and they will disown their part-
ners.  
14. On the Day when the Hour takes place —
on that Day they will separate.  
15. As for those who believed and did g ood 
deeds —they will be delighted in meadows.  
16. But as for those who disbelieved, and re-
jected Our signs and the encounter of the 
Hereafter —those will be hauled into the tor-
ment.  
17. So glorify Allah when you retire at night, 
and when you rise in the morning.
