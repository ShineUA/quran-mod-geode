## 26.  THE POETS   (ash-Shu’ara’)  
194. Upon your heart, that you may be one of 
the warners.  
195. In a clear Arabic tongue.  
196. And it is in the scriptures of the ancients.  
197. Is it not a sign for them that the scholars 
of the Children of Israel recognized it?  
198. Had We revealed it to one of the foreign-
ers. 
199. And he had recited it to them, they still 
would not have believed in it.  
200. Thus We make it pass through the hearts 
of the guilty.  
201. They will not believe in it until they wit-
ness the painful punishment.  
202. It will come to them suddenly, while they 
are unaware.  
203. Then they will say, “Are we given any res-
pite?”  
204. Do they seek to hasten Our punishment?  
205. Have you considered: if We let them enjoy 
themselves for some years.  
206. Then the re comes to them what they were 
promised.  
207. Of what avail to them will be their past en-
joyments?  
208. Never did We destroy a town, but it had 
warners.  
209. As a reminder —We are never unjust.  
210. It was not the devils that revealed it.  
211. It is not i n their interests, nor in their 
power.  
212. They are barred from hearing.  
213. So do not pray to another god with Allah, 
else you will be of those tormented.  
214. And warn your close relatives.  
215. And lower your wing to those of the be-
lievers who follow you.  
216. And if they disobey you, say, “I am inno-
cent of what you do.”  
217. And put your trust in the Almighty, the 
Merciful.  218. He Who sees you when you rise.  
219. And your devotions amidst the wor-
shipers.  
220. He is indeed the Hearer, the Aware.  
221. Shall I inform you upon whom the devils 
descend?  
222. They descend upon every sinful liar.  
223. They give ear, and most of them are liars.  
224. And as for the poets —the deviators follow 
them.  
225. Do you not see how they ramble in every 
style?  
226. And how  they say what they do not do?  
227. Except for those who believe, and do good 
deeds, and remember Allah frequently, and 
defend themselves after they are wronged. As for those who do wrong, they will know by 
what overturning they will be overturned.  
  
## 27. THE ANT  (an-Naml ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Ta, Seen. These are the Signs of the Quran —
a book that makes things clear.  
2. Guidance and good news for the believers.  
3. Those who observe the prayers, and give 
charity regularly, and are certain of the Here-
after.  
4. As for those who do not believe in the Here-
after: We made their deeds appear good to 
them, so they wander aimlessly.  
5. It is they who will receive the grievous pun-
ishment —and in the Hereafter they will be 
the greatest lose rs. 
6. You are receiving the Quran from an All -
Wise, All -Knowing.  
7. When Moses said to his family, “I have 
glimpsed a fire. I will bring you some news 
from it; or bring you a firebrand, that you may warm yourselves.”
