## 5.  THE TABLE   (al-Ma’idah)
from  among those responsible for the claim, 
and have them swear by Allah, “Our testi-
mony is more truthful than their testimony, 
and we will not be biased, for then we would 
be wrongdoers.”  
108. That makes it more likely that they will 
give true testimony, fear ing that their oaths 
might be contradicted by subsequent oaths. 
So fear Allah, and listen. Allah does not guide the disobedient people.  
109. On the Day when Allah will gather the 
messengers, then say, “What response were 
you given?” They will say, “We have no 
knowledge; it is you who are the Knower of 
the unseen.”  
110. When Allah will say, “O Jesus son of Mary, 
recall My favor upon you and upon your 
mother, how I supported you with the Holy 
Spirit. You spoke to the people from the crib, 
and in maturity. How  I taught you the Scrip-
ture and wisdom, and the Torah and the Gos-pel. And recall that you molded from clay the 
shape of a bird, by My leave, and then you 
breathed into it, and it became a bird, by My 
leave. And you healed the blind and the lep-rous, by My l eave; and you revived the dead, 
by My leave. And recall that I restrained the Children of Israel from you when you 
brought them the clear miracles. But those 
who disbelieved among them said, `This is 
nothing but obvious sorcery.'“  
111. “And when I inspired  the disciples: `Be-
lieve in Me and in My Messenger.' They said, 
`We have believed, so bear witness that We 
have submitted.'“  
112. “And when the disciples said, 'O Jesus son 
of Mary, is your Lord able to bring down for 
us a feast from heaven?' He said, 'Fear Allah, 
if you are believers.'“  
113. They said, “We wish to eat from it, so that 
our hearts may be reassured, and know that 
you have told us the truth, and be among 
those who witness it.”  
114. Jesus son of Mary said, “O Allah, our Lord, 
send down for us a table from heaven, to be a 
festival for us, for the first of us, and the last of us, and a sign from You; and provide for 
us; You are the Best of providers.”  
115. Allah said, “I will send it down to you. But 
whoever among you disbelieves thereafter, I 
will punish him with a punishment the like of 
which I never punish any other being.”  
116. And Allah will say, “O Jesus son of Mary, 
did you say to the people, `Take me and my 
mother as gods rather than Allah?'“ He will say, “Glory be to You! It is not for me to say 
what I have no right to. Had I said it, You 
would have known it. You know what is in 
my soul, and I do not know what is in your 
soul. You are the Knower of the hidden.  
117. I only told them what You commanded 
me: that you shall worship Allah, my Lor d 
and your Lord. And I was a witness over them 
while I was among them; but when You took 
me to Yourself, you became the Watcher over 
them —You are Witness over everything.  
118. If You punish them, they are Your serv-
ants; but if You forgive them, You are the  
Mighty and Wise.”  
119. Allah will say, “This is a Day when the 
truthful will benefit from their truthfulness.” 
They will have Gardens beneath which rivers 
flow, wherein they will remain forever. Allah 
is pleased with them, and they are pleased 
with Him. T hat is the great attainment.  
120. To Allah belongs the sovereignty of the 
heavens and the earth and what lies in them, 
and He has power over everything.  
  
## 6. LIVESTOCK  (al-An’am ) 
In the name of Allah,  
the Gracious, the Merciful  
1. Praise be to Allah, Who created the heavens 
and the earth, and made the darkness and the 
light. Yet those who disbelieve ascribe equals 
to their Lord.  
2. It is He who created you from clay, then de-
cided a term —a term determined by him. Yet 
you doubt.
